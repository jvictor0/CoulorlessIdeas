I must say a word about fear. 
It is life's only true opponent. 
Only fear can defeat life. 
It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. 
It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy.

It begins in your mind, always ... 
so you must fight hard to express it. 
You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it.

So what is it?""
Suffering," she said. "

That's the problem. 
Bolivar was talking about the pain, not about the living or dying. 
How do you get out of the labyrinth of suffering?... 
Nothing's wrong.

At times!

I am an unpleasant man.  
I think my liver is diseased.  
However, I don't know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me.  
I don't treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors.  
Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let's say sufficiently so to respect medicine.  (
I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.)  
No, I refuse to treat it out of spite.  
You probably will not understand that.  
Well, but I understand it.

But still, if I don't treat it, its is out of spite.  My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!

It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! 
Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. 
And the only laws are paradox, humor and change.

Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. 
No need to resist life, just do your best. 
Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. 
You are the world, you are the universe; 
you are yourself and everyone else, too! 
It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, just be happy. You are already free!

The glory of Christianity is to conquer by forgiveness.
Words do not express thoughts very well;

What thousand words? 
A thousand words from a lunatic, or a thousand words from Nietzsche? 
Actually, Nietzsche was a lunatic, but you see my point. 
What about a thousand words from a rambler vs. 500 
words from Mark Twain? 
He could say the same thing quicker and with more force than almost any other writer. 
One thousand words from Ginsberg are not even worth one from Wilde. 
It’s wild to declare the equivalency of any picture with any army of 1,000 words. 
Words from a writer like Wordsworth make you appreciate what words are worth.
All men by nature desire knowledge.
I suppose therefore that all things I see are illusions; 
I believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me.

The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.
Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred tutelage. 
Tutelage is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another. 
Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is.
I'm not frightened. 
I'm not frightened of anything. 
The more I suffer, the more I love. 
Danger will only increase my love. 
It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. 
I will be the only angel you need. 
You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. 
Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love.
There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.
For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. 
He has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to our collective memory. 
To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.
Our lives are part of a unique adventure... 
But where was God now, with heaven full of astronauts, and the Lord overthrown? 
I miss God. 
I miss the company of someone utterly loyal. 
I still don't think of God as my betrayer. 
The servants of God, yes, but servants by their very nature betray. 
I miss God who was my friend. 
...reality is always plural and mutable.
We look for the Secret - the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of the Wise, Supreme Enlightenment, 'God' or whatever...
and all the time it is carrying us about...It is the human nervous system itself.
If you ever find yourself in the wrong story, leave.
The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. 
Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. 
He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. 
They are both helpless—one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. 
The Tolstoyan’s will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. 
But the Nietzscheite’s will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; 
for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. 
They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. 
The result is—well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.
If you don't want anyone to know about your existence, you might as well kill yourself. You're taking up space, air.
I do not think that tragedy is our natural fate and I do not live in chronic dread of disaster. 
It is no happiness, but suffering that I consider unnatural. 
It is not success, but calamity that I regard as the abnormal exception in Human Life.
Whatever one man does, it is as if all men did it. 
For that reason, it is not unfair that one disobedience in a garden should contaminate all humanity; 
for that reason it is not unjust that the crucifixion of a single Jew should be sufficient to save it.
Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth.
The discovery of what is true and the practice of that which is good are the two most important aims of philosophy.
Of course there is no formula for success, except perhaps an unconditional acceptance of life, and what it brings
Mankind flung its advance agents ever outward, ever outward. 
Eventually it flung them out into space, into the colorless, tasteless, weightless sea of outwardness without end. 
It flung them like stones.
A few years ago it dawned on me that everybody past a certain age ... 
pretty much constantly dreams of being able to escape from their lives. 
They don't want to be who they are any more. 
They want out. 
The point of modernity is to live a life without illusions while not becoming disillusioned
Sin sorpresas, aunque sean disagredables, nadie estaria dispuesto a vivir.
Although you may not stumble across a Martian in the garden, you might stumble across yourself. 
The day that happens, you'll probably also scream a little. 
I was never aware of any other option but to question everything.
The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free.
The pianokeys are black and whitebut they sound like a million colors in your mind
Life—the way it really is—is a battle not between good and bad, but between bad and worse
To be alone is to be different, to be different is to be alone.
A philosopher knows that in reality he knows very little.  
That is why he constantly strives to achieve true insight.  
Socrates was one of these rare people.  
He knew that he knew nothing about life and about the world.  
And now comes the important part: it troubled him that he knew so little.
I'm looking into my past lives. I'm convinced some of them still owe me money.
Who is wise? 
He that learns from everyone. 
Who is powerful? He that governs his passions. Who is rich? He that is content. Who is that? Nobody.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
Eccentricity is not, as some would believe, a form of madness. 
Never say that I have taken it, only that I have given it back.
It takes too much energy to be against something unless it's really important. 
songs, to me, were more important than just light entertainment. 
They were my preceptor and guide into some altered consciousness of reality. 
Some different republic, some liberated republic... 
whatever the case, it wasn't that I was anti-popular culture or anything and I had no ambition to stir things up. 
I just thought of mainstream culture as lame as hell and a big trick. 
It was like the unbroken sea of frost that lay outside the window and you had to have awkward footgear to walk with.
It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it. 
In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life. 
You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin. 
That brought you down to earth. That gave you a reason for going on. Pumpkin.
L'homme est libre au moment qu'il veut l'être.
Thoughts become things. If you see it in your mind, you will hold it in your hand.
In the end mortals always expired before faeries. 
They were such finite creatures. 
Their first heartbeat and breath were but a blink from death. 
To add the weight of nourishing his insatiable court in a time of peace was to hasten that unconscionably.
People ought to fight to keep their law as to defend the citys walls.
You asked me how to get out of the finite dimensions when I feel like it.  
I certainly don't use logic when I do it.  Logic's the first thing you have to get rid of.
There's only one day at a time here, then it's tonight and then tomorrow will be today again.
Rockabye Baby, in the treetopDont you know a treetopis no safe place to rock?

Imagine that one day you are out for a walk in the woods. 
Suddenly you see a small spaceship on the path in front of you. 
A tiny Martian climbs out the spaceship and stands on the ground looking up at you…What would you think? 
Never mind, it’s not important. 
But have you ever given any thought to the fact that you are a Martian yourself?
It is obviously unlikely that you will ever stumble upon a creature from another planet. 
We do not even know that there is life on other planets. 
But you might stumble upon yourself one day. 
You might suddenly stop short and see yourself in a completely new light. 
On just such a walk in the woods. 
I am an extraordinary being, you think. 
I am a mysterious creature.
You feel as if you are waking from an enchanted slumber. 
Who am I? 
you ask. 
You know that you are stumbling around on a planet in the universe. 
But what is the universe?
Before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. 
The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.
So, let me get this straight-- You want me to stop being a lesbian and being attracted to women because it is a 'sin'? 
Last time I checked, when you lie you are sinning. 
Il n'y a de réalité que dans l'action.(There is no reality except in action.)
As soon as you have made a thought, laugh at it.
I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; 
he says again and again 'I know that that’s a tree', pointing to a tree that is near us. 
Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell him: 'This fellow isn’t insane. We are only doing philosophy.
The only safe thing is to take a chance.
If you wake up tired, you’ve been chasing dreams. If you go to bed tired, your making your dreams happen.
Any war that requires the suspension of reason as a necessity for support is a bad war.
To study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one’s self to die.
Imagine that you were on the threshold of this fairytale, sometime billions of years ago when everything was created. 
And you were able to choose whether you wanted to be born to a life on this planet at some point. 
Change is not always growth, but growth is often rooted in change.Drizzt Do'Urden
Nothing important is learned; it is simply remembered.
My heart knows what my mind only think it knows.
To be an outlaw you must first have a base in law to reject and get out of, I never had such a base. 
I never had a place I could call home that meant any more than a key to a house, apartment or hotel room. … 
Am I alien? 
Alien from what exactly? 
Perhaps my home is my dream city, more real than my waking life precisely because it has no relation to waking life…
Imagine others complexly.
A man leaves his great house because he's boredWith life at home, and suddenly returns,Finding himself no happier abroad.
In practice people who study philosophy too long become very odd birds, not to say thoroughly vicious; 
while even those who are the best of them are reduced by...[philosophy] to complete uselessness as members of society.
Nothing is as it seems, but something is everything it is made out to be.
How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?
The shame of being a man - is there any better reason to write?
Philosophy is really nostalgia, the desire to be at home.
And although I have seen nothing but black crows in my life, it doesn't mean that there's no such thing as a white crow.  
Both for a philosopher and for a scientist it can be important not to reject the possibility of finding a white crow.  
You might almost say that hunting for 'the white crow' is science's principal task.
I strive for perfection - I settle for satisfaction
The man who alters his way of thinking to suit others is a fool.
If you haven't said 'I love you' to someone today, do it. 
You won't always be happy, but you should try to be. 
Don't be too afraid of germs. 
Those people have no fun. 
Remember to look around sometimes. 
You might see something you haven't seen before or at the very least avoid being hit by a flying object. 
Speaking of flying objects, don't spend your life looking for extraterrestrial life, unless you work for NASA. 
Remember that you always have to cooperate with someone. 
Life is an endless negotiation. 
Play fair. 
Stay out of jail. 
Don't live in the past. 
Eat breakfast. 
It really is the most important meal of the day. 
Try to make new friends, even when you think you're too old to do that. ...
And finally, remember this" 'Yes' is always a better work than 'no'. 
Unless, of course, someone has just asked you to commit a felony.
Everybody knows that Aristotelian two-value logic is fucked.
Only by examining our personal biases can we truly grow as artists; 
only by cultivating empathy can we truly grow as people.
Don’t only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and knowledge can raise men to the divine.
Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.
Non est ad astra mollis e terris via" - "There is no easy way from the earth to the stars
If you don't behave as you believe, you will end by believing as you behave.
You say, it's dark. 
And in truth, I did place a cloud before your sun. 
But do you not see how the edges of the cloud are already glowing and turning light.
So now you must choose... 
Are you a child who has not yet become world-weary? 
Or are you a philosopher who will vow never to become so? 
To children, the world and everything in it is new, something that gives rise to astonishment. 
It is not like that for adults. 
Most adults accept the world as a matter of course. 
This is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception. 
A philosopher never gets quite used to the world. 
To him or her, the world continues to seem a bit unreasonable - bewildering, even enigmatic. 
Philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common. 
The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder…
No man was ever wise by chance
What sort of philosophers are we, who know absolutely nothing of the origin and destiny of cats?
Not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystery.
The life of the enemy . Whoever lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in the enemy's staying alive.
What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. 
In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. 
This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.
YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf, I am the smaller one on its upper side,'said the dewdrop to the lake.

it's the gas you breathe. 
The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.
If you're not happy in life then you need to change, calibrate, readjust...
flush your negative energy and fill it with positive energy; 
How do we do that you might ask? 
well I would start by making others happy, deseases are not the only thing that spreads easy. 
We are all connected in some form of unseen energy... 
think how those around you will impact you and make you feel if they were happy?
I’ve always hated the “Who are you?" 
question. 
This is a philosophical inquiry. 
Answering that question is why we’re on earth. You can’t answer it in thirty seconds or in an elevator.
I always thought old age would be a writer’s best chance.  
Whenever I read the late work of Goethe or W. 
B. 
Yeats I had the impertinence to identify with it.  
Now, my memory’s gone, all the old fluency’s disappeared.  
I don’t write a single sentence without saying to myself, ‘It’s a lie!’  
So I know I was right. It’s the best chance I’ve ever had.
Life... is a paradise to what we know of death.
Death isn't the end, it's the beginning.
No man was ever yet a great poet, without at the same time being a profound philosopher.
Philosophy when superficially studied, excites doubt, when thoroughly explored, it dispels it.
The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. 
The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly.
I've often thought that there isn't any "I" at all; 
that we are simply the means of expression of something else; 
that when we think we are ourselves, we are simply the victims of a delusion.
When it comes to Schopenhauer, I think I need a To-Go box. 
Criticism of others is thus an oblique form of self-commendation. 
We think we make the picture hang straight on our wall by telling our neighbors that all his pictures are crooked.
Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.
My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.
Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. 
I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. 
Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. 
Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; 
You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits.
They can't tell so much about you if you got your eyes closed.
Here is my final point. 
About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography and smoking and everything else. 
Once upon a time there was a young prince who believed in all things but three. 
He did not believe in princesses, he did not believe in islands, he did not believe in God. 
His father, the king, told him that such things did not exist. 
As there were no princesses or islands in his father's domains, and no sign of God, the young prince believed his father.
But then, one day, the prince ran away from his palace. 
He came to the next land. 
I desire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under the motto 'to live well you must live unseen
We are here and it is now. The way I see it is, after that, everything tends towards guesswork.
Young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit. 
Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit.
No lake so still but it has its wave.
No circle so perfect but that it has its blur.
I would change things for you if I could; As I can't you must take them as they are.
Digression is the soul of wit. 
Take the philosophic asides away from Dante, Milton or Hamlet's father's ghost and what stays is dry bones.
There are 10,000 books in my library, and it will keep growing until I die. 
This has exasperated my daughters, amused my friends and baffled my accountant. 
If I had not picked up this habit in the library long ago, I would have more money in the bank today; 
I would not be richer.
She smiled. 
She knew she was dying. 
But it did not matter any longer. 
She had known something which no human words could ever tell and she knew it now. 
She had been awaiting it and she felt it, as if it had been, as if she had lived it. 
The Study of philosophy is not that we may know what men have thought, but what the truth of things is. 
In the high country of the mind one has to become adjusted to the thinner air of uncertainty...
As soon as a religion comes to dominate it has as its opponents all those who would have been its first disciples. 
No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature.  
Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; 
the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong is what is against it.
Patience is the only way you can endure the gray periods.
I consist of body and soul - in the worlds of a child. 
And why shouldn't we speak like children? 
But the enlightened, the knowledgealbe would say: I am body through and through, nothing more; 
and the soul is just a word for something on the body.
There is something fascinating about science.  
One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.
You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.
I have gained this by philosophy: that I do without being commanded what others do only from fear of the law.
Creation and destruction are the two ends of the same moment. 
And everything between the creation and the next destruction is the journey of life.
Neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily.

The treacherous are ever distrustful.
He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing .
If there were a party of those who aren't sure they're right, I'd belong to it. ~(Camus, as quoted by Tony Judt)
In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. 
No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. 
Things are not always what they seem; 
the first appearance deceives many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.
When you draw something it lives and when you photograph it it dies
I do feel that I’ve managed to make something I could maybe call my world…over time…little by little. 
And when I’m inside it, to some extent, I feel kind of relieved. 
For every expert there is an equal and opposite expert.
We are the sum of all people we have ever met; you change the tribe and the tribe changes you.
Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.
I felt the taste of mortality in my mouth, and at that moment I understood that I was not going to live forever. 
By what men think, we create the world around us, daily new.
It's easy to hate and point out everything that is wrong with the world; 
it is the hardest and most important work in one's life to free oneself from the bonds of fear and attachment.
So you think that money is the root of all evil? [...] 
Have you ever asked what is the root of money? 
Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. 
But love, like the sun that it is, sets afire and melts everything. 
A Paradox, the doughnut hole. 
Empty space, once, but now they've learned to market even that. 
A minus quantity; 
nothing, rendered edible. 
I wondered if they might be used-metaphorically, of course-to demonstrate the existence of God. 
Does naming a sphere of nothingness transmute it into being?
Life is a bitter sweet journey my friend, a bitter sweet journey.

You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.
Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.
Sed nescio quo modo nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosphorum. (
There is nothing so absurd but some philosopher has said it.)
Love is patient; 
love is kind and envies no one. 
Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude; 
never selfish, not quick to take offense. 
Love keeps no score of wrongs; 
does not gloat over other men's sins, but delights in the truth. 
There is nothing love cannot face; 
there is no limit to its faith,its hope, and endurance. [....] 
In a word, there are three things that last forever: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of them all is love.
the serpent if it wants to become the dragon must eat itself.
I have gone around observing your activities from the outside. 
Because of this I have also been able to see things to which you have been blind... 
Every morning you have gone to work, but you have never been fully awake. 
I have forgotten my umbrella. 
Life's managed, not cured.  
For this feeling of wonder shows that you are a philosopher, since wonder is the only beginning of philosophy.
No rational argument will have a rational effect on a man who does not want to adopt a rational attitude.
Reality is harsh. 
It can be cruel and ugly. 
Yet no matter how much we grieve over our environment and circumstances nothing will change. 
What is important is not to be defeated, to forge ahead bravely. If we do this, a path will open before us.
A prison becomes a home when you have the key.
We live in deeds  not years  In thoughts  not breaths  In feelings  not figures on a dial. 
We should count time by heart throbs. He most lives who thinks most, feels noblest, acts the best.
The trouble was that he was talking in philosophy but they were listening in gibberish.
Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see, but it is impossible. 
Humans hide their secrets too well....
True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one's self; 
but the point is not only to get out - you must stay out; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand.
Few if any seemed to have grasped the Principle of Reality; 
new knowledge leads always to yet more awesome mysteries.  
But it so happens that everything on this planet is, ultimately, irrational; 
To live is to change, to acquire the words of a story, and that is the only celebration we mortals really know.
Those who are without compassion cannot see what is seen with the eyes of compassion.

When faith in our freedom gives way to fear of our freedom, silencing the minority view becomes the operative protocol.
Where we choose to be, where we choose to be--we have the power to determine that in our lives. 
We cannot reel time backward or forward, but we can take ourselves to the place that defines our being.
I knew I was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before.
I won't think of it now. I can't stand it now. I'll think of it later.
Me, I've seen 45 years, and I've only figured out one thing. 
That's this: if a person would just make the effort, there's something to be learned from everything. 
From even the most ordinary, commonplace things, there's always something you can learn. 
I read somewhere that they said there's even different philosophies in razors. 
Fact is, if it weren't for that, nobody'd survive.
The student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. 
He feels himself inadequate and thinks he will not understand him. 
But if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible than his modern commentator. 
The simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very great deal of what Plato said; 
but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on Platonism.
Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
Death twitches my ear;'Live,' he says... 'I'm coming.
Deliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight.

Creativity sparks originality which then manifests itself into what we call evolution. 
To depreciate imagination is to depreciate life.
I've learned recently to love imperfection a lot because it shines such a big light on God's grace. 
Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way.
Few things are more deceptive than memories.
The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. 
Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. 
It is essential to attain this. 
If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.
Some people insist that 'mediocre' is better than 'best.' 
They delight in clipping wings because they themselves can't fly. They despise brains because they have none.
Why are there beings at all, instead of Nothing?
Crazy Horse dreamed and went into the world where there is nothing but the spirits of all things. 
That is the real world that is behind this one, and everything we see here is something like a shadow from that one.
How small a thought it takes to fill a life.
It is hard to be angry when one has seen the sun rise,' she said.
It seems to be true,' he admitted. '
I wonder why.'
Because it makes one feel so small and insignificant. 
It has been rising forever and will rise forever no matter what we do or do not do. 
All our problems are as nothing to the sun.
...the rarest of all human qualities is consistency.
Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?
The mark of your ignorance is the depth of your belief in injustice and tragedy. 
What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.
    To be pleasant, gentle, calm and self-possessed: this is the basis of good taste and charm in a woman. 
I don't think the real America is in New York or on the Pacific Coast; 
personally, I like the Middle West much better, places like North and South Dakota, Minneapolis and Saint Paul. 
There, I think, are the true Americans
The stronger a culture, the less it fears the radical fringe.  
The more paranoid and precarious a culture, the less tolerance it offers.
Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn; 
and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking; learning naturally results.
I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect.
A student, filled with emotion and crying, implored, "Why is there so much suffering?"Suzuki Roshi replied, "No reason.

In reality there are no separate events.  
Life moves along like water, it's all connected to the source of the river is connected to the mouth and the ocean.
Life is much more successfully looked at from a single window.
Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has powers of reality.
To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.
If you've got the truth you can demonstrate it.  Talking doesn't prove it.
No passion is stronger in the breast of a man than the desire to make others believe as he believes. 
False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.
O how incomprehensible everything was, and actually sad, although it was also beautiful. 
One knew nothing. 
What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind.  
Which came first, the mind or the idea of the mind? 
Have you never wondered? They arrived together. The mind is an idea.
Consider the cattle, grazing as they pass you by. 
Anyone who fights for the future, lives in it today.
Believe me there is no such thing as great suffering, great regret, great memory....
everything is forgotten, even a great love. 
That's what's sad about life, and also what's wonderful about it. 
There is only a way of looking at things, a way that comes to you every once in a while. 
There are so many kinds of time. 
The time by which we measure our lives. 
Months and years. 
Or the big time, the time that raises mountains and makes stars. 
Or all the things that happen between one heartbeat and the next. 
Its hard to live in all those kinds of times. Easy to forget that you live in all of them.
We can't avoid reasoning; we can only avoid doing it well.
Cannibals? 
Who is not a cannibal? 
A lot of people experience the world with the same incredulity as when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat.…
We know that the world is not all sleight of hand and deception because we are in it, we are part of it. 
Actually we are the white rabbit being pulled out of the hat. 
What if nobody showed up at Armageddon?
The best things in life are crazy.
Man's naked form belongs to no particular moment in history; 
it is eternal, and can be looked upon with joy by the people of all ages.
We are the inheritors of a wonderful world, a beautiful world, full of life and mystery, goodness and pain. 
But likewise are we the children of an indifferent universe. 
We break our own hearts imposing our moral order on what is, by nature, a wide web of chaos.
Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity.
Whoever will be free must make himself free. 
Freedom is no fairy gift to fall into a man's lap. What is freedom? To have the will to be responsible for one's self.

It may be either good or evil. 
As long as art remained primarily mimetic, the evil which imagination could do was limited by nature. 
Again, as long as it was treated as an amusement, the evil which it could do was limited in scope.

Pragmatism asks its usual question. "
Grant an idea or belief to be true," it says, "what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life?

The debate was wearing me out. 
Once you've posed that question, it won't go away. 
I think many people kill themselves simply to stop the debate about whether they will or they won't. 
Anything I thought or did was immediately drawn into the debate.

Our knowledge of circumstances has increased, but our uncertainty, instead of having diminished, has only increased.

All resistance is a rupture with what is. 
And every rupture begins, for those engaged in it, through a rupture with oneself.
Our actions are guaranteed to affect others. 
Because we are not alone in this world, much of our learning about ourselves comes from our interaction with others. 
Our relationships are our teachers. We learn from each other.

Where, then, is this Ego, if it be neither in the body nor in the soul? 
And how love the body or the soul, except for these qualities which do not constitute me, since they are perishable?

That is what your visions revealed to you. 
Only the mind resists change. 
When you relax mindless into the body, you are happy and content and free, sensing no separation. 
Immortality is Already yours, but not in the same way you imagined or hope for.

The egocentric is always frustrated, simply because the condition of self-perfection is self-surrender. 
There must be a willingness to die to the lower part of self, before there can be a birth to the nobler.
Philosophy is an amazing tissue of really fine thinking and incredible, puerile mistakes.

Man’s mind is his basic tool of survival. 
Life is given to him, survival is not. 
His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. 
His mind is given to him, its content is not. 
To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. 
He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. 
He cannot dig a ditch – or build a cyclotron – without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. 
To remain alive, he must think.	“

Before you hate something you should try to understand it.
Maybe I’m strange and perverse, but I’ve always thought there was something sexy about a compelling argument.
I am dead because I lack desire,I lack desire because I think I possess.
I think I possess because I do not try to give.
In trying to give, you see that you have nothing;
Seeing that you have nothing, you try to give of yourself;
Trying to give of yourself, you see that you are nothing:Seeing that you are nothing, you desire to become;
In desiring to become, you begin to live.
Those who know that they are profound strive for clarity. 
Those who would like to seem profound to the crowd strive for obscurity.

The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. 
It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.

Well Moses wouldn't believe it. 
Tom Verde: Izzi... 
Izzi: [embraces Tom] No, no.

He said that if they dug his father's body up, it would be gone. 
They planted a seed over his grave.

This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand. 
Because I don't like women in skirts and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. 
Then you have the pants under the skirt and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. 
And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape. So I think this is the best costume for today.
We love ourselves notwithstanding our faults, and we ought to love our friends in like manner.

Philosophy is not a spectator sport.
He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will not escape.

he asked, "Where are you today, right now?"
Eagerly, I started talking about myself. 
However, I noticed that I was still being sidetracked from getting answers to my questions. 
Still, I told him about my distant and recent past and about my inexplicable depressions. 
He listened patiently and intently, as if he had all the time in the world, until I finished several hours later."

The universe is well, there are theories about how it's shaped...""
That's not what I asked. 
Where is it?""
I don't know - how can I answer that?""
That is the point. 
You cannot answer it, and you never will. 
There is no knowing about it. 
You are ignorant of where the universe is, and thus, where you are. 
In fact, you have no knowledge of where anything is or of What anything is or how is came to be.

The most important thing about a technology is how it changes people.

In a world of chance is there a better and a worse? 
We yield to a stranger's embrace or give ourselves to the waves; 
for the blink of an eyelid our vigilance relaxes; 
we are asleep; 
and when we awake, we have lost the direction of our lives. 
What are these blinks of an eyelid, against which the only defence is an eternal and inhuman wakefulness? 
Might they not be the cracks and chinks through which another voice, other voices, speak in our lives? 
By what right do we close our ears to them? (Susan Barton)

Irreverence is a most necessary ingredient of religion.

And that’s not just a statement about table etiquette;

Charity is no substitute for justice withheld.
Life:  It is better not to wrap philosophy around such an inconceivable evolving beautiful mystery.

If you alone found out what the lie was, then you're probably right—it would make no great difference.  
But if you ALL found out what the lie was, it might conceivably make a very great difference indeed.
As a rule, we don't like to feel to sad or lonely or depressed. 
So why do we like music (or books or movies) that evoke in us those same negative emotions? 
Why do we choose to experience in art the very feelings we avoid in real life?
Aristotle deals with a similar question in his analysis of tragedy. 
Tragedy, after all, is pretty gruesome. […] 
There's Sophocles's Oedipus, who blinds himself after learning that he has killed his father and slept with his mother. 
Why would anyone watch this stuff? 
Wouldn't it be sick to enjoy watching it? […] 
Tragedy's pleasure doesn't make us feel "good" in any straightforward sense. 
On the contrary, Aristotle says, the real goal of tragedy is to evoke pity and fear in the audience. 
Now, to speak of the pleasure of pity and fear is almost oxymoronic. 
Astonishment is the root of philosophy.

Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred.

We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted.  
Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use.

¿A qué se reduce, pues, el progreso? 
Progresa la ciencia, progresa la técnica. 
El hombre de nuestros días maneja técnicas cuyos fundamentos ignora, pero cuyos resultados aprovecha. 
La pseudo-doctrina del progreso diviniza el futuro y espera el advenimiento de un estado perfecto. 
En una época que no se precisa, la historia universal de la humanidad habrá resuelto todos sus problemas. 
Lo que cuenta es el hombre futuro. 
Las generaciones presentes son simples eslabones sin ninguna finalidad propia. 
El presente se evapora en aras de un progresismo inocente y filisteo.

The question has often been asked; 
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?  
It does not matter what you call it.  
Buddhism remains what it is whatever label you may put on it.  
The label is immaterial.  
Even the label 'Buddhism' which we give to the teachings of the Buddha is of little importance.  
The name one gives is inessential....

William James describes a man who got the experience from laughing-gas; 
whenever he was under its influence, he knew the secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had forgotten it.

Der Mensch ist Etwas, das überwunden werden soll. 
Was habt ihr gethan, ihn zu überwinden? 
Was ist der Affe für en Menschen? 
Ein Gelächter oder eine schmerzliche Scham. 
Und ebendas soll der Mensch für den Übermenschen sein: ein Gelächter oder eine schmerzliche Scham. 
Ihr habt den Weg vom Wurme zum Menschen gemacht, und Vieles ist in euch noch Wurm. 
Einst wart ihr Affen, und auch jetzt ist der Mensch mehr Affe, als irgend ein Affe.
Съвестта е онзи глас Божий в нас, онова огледало, в което ние се оглеждаме и виждаме своите недостатъци.
Without causality in the world, there is no point in educating people, or making any moral or political appeal.
LORD ILLINGWORTH: The soul is born old but grows young. 
That is the comedy of life.MRS ALLONBY: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life's tragedy.
Anyone who says that economic security is a human right, has been to much babied. 
While he babbles, other men are risking and losing their lives to protect him. 
Supposing there is no life everlasting. 
Think what it means if death is really the end of all things. 
They've given up all for nothing. 
They've been cheated. 
They're dupes."
Waddington reflected for a little while. "
I wonder if it matters what they have aimed at is illusion. 
Their lives are in themselves beautiful. 
What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?
I am a citizen of the world.
A man must not be without shame, for the shame of being without shame is shamelessness indeed.
No one else can want for me.  
No one can substitute his act of will for mine.  
It does sometimes happen that someone very much wants me to want what he wants.  
This is the moment when the impassable frontier between him and me, which is drawn by free will, becomes most obvious.  
I may not want that which he wants me to want - and in this precisely I am incommunicabilis.  
I am, and I must be, independent in my actions.  All human relationships are posited on this fact.
If we thought more for ourselves we would have very many more bad books and very many more good ones.
When they have discovered truth in nature they fling it into a book, where it is even worse hands.
Question everything, unless it's the answer

Latter-day capitalism. 
Like it or not, it's the society we live in. 
Even the standard of right and wrong has been subdivided, made sophisticated. 
Within good, there's fashionable good and unfashionable good, and ditto for bad. 
Within fashionable good, there's formal and then there's casual; 
there's hip, there's cool, there's trendy, there's snobbish. 
Mix 'n' match. 
Like pulling on a Missoni sweater over Trussardi slacks and Pollini shoes, you can now enjoy hybrid styles of morality. 
It's the way of the world -- philosophy starting to look more and more like business administration.

It's harder to make the glass than break the glass.
The fundament upon which all our knowledge and learning rests is the inexplicable.
One never knows how the witch became wicked, or whether that was the right choice for her — is it ever the right choice? 
Does the devil ever struggle to be good again, or if so is he not a devil? 
It is the very least question of definitions.

She said, "You're a warrior. 
So how do you kill without rage?""
In compassion. 
Because of necessity." Hrahima set the empty water bowl back in Samarkar's hands. "The same way you carry water.
When the Aggregates arise, decay and die, O bhikkhu, every moment you are born, decay, and die.
Honor has not to be won; it must only not be lost.
The time of a man's life is as a point; 
the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; 
and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. 
His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; 
to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; 
as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. 
Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. 
Fame after life is no better than oblivion. 
What is it then that will adhere and follow? 
Only one thing, philosophy. 
If you could disagree with kings, were gods so far above?
Don’t reject something just because it seems strange. It’s comfort that will kill you in the end.
Writers may be classified as meteors, planets, and fixed stars. 
They belong not to one system, one nation only, but to the universe. 
Thank heaven for people who are satisfied with facts that conform to the reality they wish to believe.
My ship came in,then it sank!
Putting food under lock and key was one of the great innovations of your culture. 
There is no such thing as objectivity.  
We are all just interpreting signals from the universe and trying to make sense of them.  
Dim, shaky, weak, static-y little signals that only hint at the complexity of a universe we cannot begin to understand.
By heavens! 
there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter. 
Steal a horse straight out. 
Very well. 
He has done it. 
Perhaps he can ride. 
But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.
The source of man's rights is not divine law or a congressional law, but the law of identity. 
A is A ___ and man is man. 
Rights are conditions of existence required by man's nature for his proper survival. 
According to the Buddha's teaching the beginning of the life-stream of living beings is unthinkable.  
THe believer in the creation of life by God may be astonished at this reply.  
But if you were to ask him 'What is the beginning of God?' 
he would answer without hesitation 'God has no beginning', and he is not astonished at his own reply.
If your dreams seem to be drifting away, wake up!
If that which we have found is the corruption of solitude, then what can men wish for save corruption? 
If this is the great evil of being alone, than what is good and what is evil?
The Philosopher's Motto: I came, I saw, I pondered!
Propounding peace and love without practical or institutional engagement is delusion, not virtue.
To be poor, ugly and, moreover, intelligent condemns one in our society to a dark and disillusioned life...
to beauty all is forgiven.
Христовият мир е свобода от греха, а мирът на света е свобода на греха...
Let education kindle only those which are truly beneficialto the human species; 
let it favour those alone which are really necessary to the maintenance of society. 
The passions of man are dangerous, only because every thing conspires to give them an evil direction.
And you don’t even need to say anything. 
I’m screwed up. 
I don’t know how any of this works anymore than you do. 
But I do believe you’re worth every second it would take to figure it out,” Mason said, a smile taking over his features.

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? - Who watches the watchmen?
Yes, you need a passport to prove to the world that you exist. 
The people at passport control, they cannot look at you and see you are a person. 
No! They have to look at a little photograph of you. Then they believe you exist.
There is no unmoving mover behind the movement.  
It is only movement.  
It is not correct to say that life is moving, but life is movement itself.  
Life and movement are not two different things.  
In other words, there is no thinker behind the thought.  
Thought itself is the thinker.  If you remove the thought, there is no thinker to be found.
To all appearances he was just drifting. In actuality he was just drifting.
Books can be immensely powerful. 
The ideas in them can change the way people think. 
For any given problem, if there's a simple solution it will already have been applied. 
So, perhaps, the solution isn't as simple as you think.
It goes without saying that these effects do not suffice to annul the necessity for a “change of terrain.”  
It also goes without saying that the choice between these two forms of deconstruction cannot be simple and unique.  
A new writing must weave and interlace these two motifs of deconstruction.  
Which amounts to saying that one must speak several languages and produce several texts at once.  
For the same reason there is nowhere to begin to trace the sheaf or the graphics of differance.  
Let us being again.  
Стихи нельзя объяснить - только понять.
The cause of our current social crises, he would have said, is a genetic defect within the nature of reason itself. 
And until this genetic defect is cleared, the crises will continue. 
Our current modes of rationality are not moving society forward into a better world. 
They are taking it further and further from that better world. 
Since the Renaissance these modes have worked. 
As long as the need for food, clothing and shelter is dominant they will continue to work. 
If once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; 
and from robbing he next comes to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination.

The cynic sees only cynicism, the depressive can taint creation with one glance
I will tell you why I became a philosopher. 
Great understanding is broad and unhurried; 
little understanding is cramped and busy.  Great words are clear and limpid; little words are shrill and quarrelsome.
The Great Way is not named; 
Great Discriminations are not spoken; 
Great Benevolence is not benevolent; 
Great Modesty is not humble; Great Daring does not attack.  If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way.
У влюбленного в безмолвие поэта есть одно спасение - речь.

Tell me something.  
Do you believe in God?'
Snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction.  '
What?  
Who still believes nowadays?''
It isn't that simple.  
I don't mean the traditional God of Earth religion.  
To live is not to breathe but to act. 
The Purpose of Philosophy is to fall in Love. 
To strip the world of all its clothes, and fall in Love with it as it stand before you completely naked.
How do we account for this paradox that the absence of Law universalizes prohibition ... 
The psychoanalytic name for this obscene injunction for this obscene call, ENJOY, is superego. 
The problem today is not how to get rid of your inhibitions and to be able to spontaneously enjoy. 
The problem is how to get rid of this injunction to enjoy.
‎In modern physics, there is no such thing as "nothing." 
Even in a perfect vacuum, pairs of virtual particles are constantly being created and destroyed. 
The existence of these particles is no mathematical fiction. 
Though they cannot be directly observed, the effects they create are quite real. 
The assumption that they exist leads to predictions that have been confirmed by experiment to a high degree of accuracy.

We had a kettle; 
we let it leak: Our not repairing made it worse. 
We haven't had any tea for a week... The bottom is out of the Universe.
we are finite, in that we are a product and source of the infinite.
What is the meaning of it Watson?
What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear?
It must tend to some end or else our universe is ruled by chance,which is unthinkable.
But what end?There is this long standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever.
Usually when people talk about the trickle-down theory, it has to do with economics.  
I need just be a bayonet, a bayonet named Diving Punishment.  
I wish I'd been born a storm.

No heart, no tears, just as a terrible gale'd have been good.  If [by doing this] I become that, then so be it.
Good man and bad man with money goes a long ways." ~ Amunhotep El Bey
The evolution revolution is here. Global sense makes common sense.
Believe me if you consult philosophy she will persuade you not to lit so long at your counting desk
When you're in the muck you can only see muck. 
If you somehow manage to float above it, you still see the muck but you see it from a different perspective. 
And you see other things too. That's the consolation of philosophy.
Truth, says instrumentalism, is what works out, that which does what you expect it to do. 
The judgment is true when you can "bank" on it and not be disappointed. 
…let us point out precisely the difficulties of empiricism as a theory of knowledge. 
First, it begins with two fixed, unchangeable ultimates--mind and matter. 
They lived like monkeys still, while their new god powers lay around them in the weeds.
A doctrine of expression rather than one of suppression makes a stronger appeal to man.
It is a well known fact that even among highly cultured peoples the belief in animism prevails generally. 
«Who are the true philosophers you have in mind?» 
he asked.                                                                                    «

That must be right, but what exactly does it mean?» he asked.
A poet is not an apostle; he drives out devils only by the power of the devil.
Philosophers console themselves with explanations.
If you use a philosophy education well, you can get your foot in the door of any industry you please. 
The darkening of the world makes the irrationality of art rational: radically darkened art.
Philosophy, which once seemed outmoded, remains alive because the moment of its realization was missed. 
By now you must have guessed: I come from another planet. 
But I will never say to you, Take me to your leaders. 
Even I - unused to your ways though I am - would never make that mistake. 
The supply of matter in the universe was never more tightly packed than it is now, or more widely spread out. 
For nothing is ever added to it or subtracted from it. 
It follows that the movement of atoms today is no different from what it was in bygone ages and always will be. 
So the things that have regularly come into being will continue to come into being in the same manner; 
they will be and grow and flourish so far as each is allowed by the laws of nature.
I can blend words easily with my pen, and show concepts from deep within. 
Yet not everyone gets the message I send. 
So why do I even let these words begin? 
Maybe they will soak in one day at the right time. 
When the readers on a new path to find. 
So for now I'll continue to drop ink and not worry about what other people think.
Art is the social antithesis of society, not directly deducible from it.
You and I are part of the colony of heaven. 
Right now, we may reside here on earth, but our passport indicates that our citizenship is in heaven. 
We are on the earth, but not of the earth.
No art takes places without inspiration. 
Every artist also needs effective knowledge of his or her tools (e.
g., 
does a certain brush function well with a particular kind of paint?). 
What’s more, artists need effective techniques for using those tools.
There is nothing more wonderful than a book.

Maybe man is nothing in particular,' Cross said gropingly. '
Maybe that's the terror of it. 
Man may be just anything at all. 
And maybe man deep down suspects this, really knows this, kind of dreams that it is true; 
but at the same time he does not want really to know it? 
May not human life on this earth be a kind of frozen fear of man at what he could possibly be? 
And every move he makes might not these moves be just to hide this awful fact? 
To twist it into something which he feels would make him rest and breathe a little easier? 
What man is is perhaps too much to be borne by man...
Though why should we expect age to mellow us?

This only is denied to God: the power to undo the past.
I know how men in exile feed on dreams of hope.
Health is the natural condition. 
When sickness occurs, it is a sign that Nature has gone off course because of a physical or mental imbalance. 
The road to health for everyone is through moderation, harmony, and a 'sound mind in a sound body'.
There is not much to be got anywhere in the world.  
It is filled with misery and pain; 
if a man escapes these, boredeom lies in wait for him at every corner.  
Nay more; 
it is evil which generally has the upper hand, and folly that makes the most noise.  
Fate is cruel and mankind pitiable.
He could very likely have appealed for leniency. 
At least he could have saved his life by agreeing to leave Athens. 
But had he done this he would not have been Socrates. He valued his conscience--and the truth-- higher than life.
The connection between art and Christ is like the connection between sunlight and the sun.  
It is, in fact, the connection between Sonlight and the Son.
Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; 
when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; 
no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. 
The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; 
the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; 
the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias.
For an author to write as he speaks is just as reprehensible as the opposite fault, to speak as he writes; 
for this gives a pedantic effect to what he says, and at the same time makes him hardly intelligible
We belittle what we cannot bear. 
We make figments out of fundamentals, all in the name of preserving our own peculiar fancies. 
The best way to secure one's own deception is to accuse others of deceit.
Tom felt his darkness. 
His father was beautiful and clever, his mother was short and mathematically sure. 
Each of his brothers and sisters had looks or gifts or fortune. 
Tom loved all of them passionately, but he felt heavy and earth-bound. 
He climbed ecstatic mountains and floundered in the rocky darkness between the peaks. 
He had spurts of bravery but they were bracketed in battens of cowardice.
One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is "Don't try to be clever." 
And, "Listen to those quiet, nagging doubts."  
Mr. 
Trask, do you think the thoughts of people suddenly become important at a given age? 
Do you have sharper feelings or clearer thoughts now than when you were ten? 
Do you see as well, hear as well, taste as vitally?

When we sense something, it is due to the movement of atoms in space. 
When I see the moon it is because "moon atoms" penetrate my eye.
Socrates: This man, on one hand, believes that he knows something, while not knowing [anything]. 
On the other hand, I – equally ignorant – do not believe [that I know anything].
It is strange the way trauma deadens curiosity. 
To suffer cruelty in excess is to be delivered from care. 
The human heart sets aside its questions when the future is too capricious. 
This is the irony of tribulation.To know the world will never be so bad.
One must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible.

What if one were to want to hunt for these hidden presences?  
You can’t just rummage around like you’re at a yard sale.  
You have to listen.

That’s what we’re doing with Walter, Jaz.

I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden. 
He says again and again, “I know that that’s a tree,” pointing to a tree that is near us. 
Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell them, “This fellow isn’t insane. We are only doing philosophy.
Do you want to achieve something or do you just want to make money?” 
asked a nearby man in a white shirt to another man in a striped shirt. 
I waited for the answer as I slowly walked past them. “
Why is it an either or question?” 
the man in the striped shirt finally murmured philosophically under a sip of beer. 
They both stood there looking at each other in thought.
Bodies are real entities. 
Surfaces and lines are but fictitious entities. 
A surface without depth, a line without thickness, was never seen by any man;

Philosophers' Syndrome: mistaking a failure of the imagination for an insight into necessity.

Water everywhere, falling in thundering cataracts, singular drops, and draping sheets. 
But no: he was empty, he was confronted by a vast anger, a desperate anger, he saw it and could almost have touched it. 
But it was inert - if it were to live and find expression and suffer, he must lend it his own body. 
It was other people's anger. "
Swine!" He clenched his fists, he strode along, but nothing came, the anger remained external to himself.
Not telling is just as interesting as telling I have found. 
The best proof that He will never cease to love us lies in that He never began.
Both [Quine and Feyerabend] want to revise a version of positivism.

Essas duas histórias - a do lado de dentro e a do lado de fora - podem ser contadas sobre cada um de nós. 
Ao chamá-las de 'histórias' não pretendo diminuí-las. 
Algumas são, apesar de tudo, verdadeiras. 
O problema é que temos muita dificuldade em ver como ambas as histórias que contamos sobre nós podem ser verdadeiras. 
O efeito da segunda história, aquela contada do lado de fora, parece uma drástica realocação do nosso papel na trama. 
Longe de sermos o personagem principal da história, estamos reduzidos a um figuração.

Manlius ... 
took care in his invitations, actively sought to exclude from his circle crude and vulgar men like Caius Valerius.  
But they were all around;

We are not religion or God, because we enter into belief in the hope we get something back for ourselves. 
We are not a soul.We are hope.

(كل قراءة خيانة مبدعة للنص).يكاد أن يكون البحث الفلسفي الراهن، في الإسلاميات وغيرها أيضاً، مُستغرقاً بأسره - إلا فيما ندر - في نطاق الشروح وتدبيج الحواشي على المتون. ومن هنا فإن قارئ "الأشعري" أو "ابن سينا" لا يختلف عن قارئ "ماركس" أو "سارتر"، فكل منهما "مريد طريقة" أو نهج واحد، وذلك من حيث أن كلاً منهما يتصور أن غاية الغايات من بحثه محصورة في مجرد "عرض" النص المقروء في أفضل لغة شارحة، لا في قراءة "واعية" للنص تلتمس -أساساً- ما يتجاوزه ويتعداه.إن التجربة المهيمنة على تلك القراءات الشارحة (
paraphrasing) هي تجربة أحادية جدباء. إنها "تجربة النص" فقط، وحتى هذه التجربة تفقد أعظم ما تنطوي عليه حين يُقرأ النص معزولاً عن مجمل سياقاته التاريخية التي أنتجته؛ أعني بالنظر إليه فقط على أنه بناء مغلق لا يحيل إلى شيء خارج ذاته.لكن من حسن الحظ أن ثمة ضرباً آخر من القراءة يتكشَّف عن مواجهة بين تجربتين - تجربة "النص" وتجربة "الشارح" - وهي مواجهة تفهم فيها الحياة نفسها، على قول "دلتاي".والحق أن هذا النهج في البحث يبدو كأحد النتاجات الجوهرية لحضارة لم تُخلِّف -منذ سنوات إفلاسها - إلا التدثُّر بالنصوص والشروح على متون الأسلاف. وهكذا لقرون عدة لم يتجاوز ما أبدعته هذه الحضارة إطار "التنصيص والتهميش". ويمكن القول إن جوهر "الأزمة" يتأتى من غياب "التاريخي" و"الإنساني" في الوعي الراهن لتلك الحضارة.ويبدو أن هذه الشروح أو القراءات غير الخائنة للنصوص التي جاوزت كل حد في أمانتها أو احتذائها للنصوص، قد تبلورت -تاريخياً- من تجربة حضارة لم تدرك تقدمها ونجاحها إلا في الوفاء لــ "نص"، هو القرآن، وذلك بغض النظر عن ضرورة قراءته في ضوء تجربة العصر؛ أي عصر.إذ النص، أي نص، يُعَد -طبقاً لتلك الشروح- ذو معنى ثابت مطلق يمكن التعرُّف عليه من خلال "تجربة عقلية محضة"، مع أن معناه ينبغي النظر إليه على أنه معنى متجدد يعيش في "قلب التجربة التاريخية" التي تتصف بالضرورة بأنها متجددة هي الأخرى.

Philosophy ... 
is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; 
One of the great problems of philosophy, is the relationship between the realm of knowledge and the realm of values. 
Knowledge is what is; 
values are what ought to be. 
I would say that all traditional philosophies up to and including Marxism have tried to derive the 'ought' from the 'is.' 
My point of view is that this is impossible, this is a farce.
There is, I assure you, a medical art for the soul.

All the philosophical theories that exist have been created by the mistaken dualistic minds of human beings.  
In the realm of philosophy, that which today is considered true, may tomorrow be proved to be false.  
No one can guarantee a philosophy's validity.  
Because of this, any intellectual way of seeing whatever is always partial and relative.  
The fact is that there is no truth to seek or to confirm logically; 
rather what one needs to do is to discover just how much the mind continually limits itself in a condition of dualism.
Dualism is the real root of our suffering and of all our conflicts.  
All our concepts and beliefs, no matter how profound they may seem, are like nets which trap us in dualism.

A lot of people ask me, 'How did you have the courage to walk up to record labels when you were 12 or 13 and jump right into the music industry?' It's because I knew I could never feel the kind of rejection that I felt in middle school. Because in the music industry, if they're gonna say no to you, at least they're gonna be polite about it.
I get mad. I get sad. I have all those emotions. But I just like to keep them to myself. I don't think my fans need to be bothered with if I'm mad or sad about something. I should just be concerned that they are keeping up with my music or I'm making them happy with my show.
This land is your land and this land is my land, sure, but the world is run by those that never listen to music anyway.
If you want to be a rock star or just be famous, then run down the street naked, you'll make the news or something. But if you want music to be your livelihood, then play, play, play and play! And eventually you'll get to where you want to be.
Writing has laws of perspective, of light and shade just as painting does, or music. If you are born knowing them, fine. If not, learn them. Then rearrange the rules to suit yourself.
Music drives you. It wakes you up, it gets you pumping. And, at the end of the day, the correct tune will chill you down.
There is this tremendous amount of arrogance and hubris, where somebody can look at something for five minutes and dismiss it. Whether you talk about gaming or 20th century classical music, you can't do it in five minutes. You can't listen to 'The Rite of Spring' once and understand what Stravinsky was all about.
Music is the art of the prophets and the gift of God.
Many people die with their music still in them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out.
My body is damaged from music in two ways. I have a red irritation in my stomach. It's psychosomatic, caused by all the anger and the screaming. I have scoliosis, where the curvature of your spine is bent, and the weight of my guitar has made it worse. I'm always in pain, and that adds to the anger in our music.
If you talk bad about country music, it's like saying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words.
Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.
Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful; so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.
I think everybody can agree that you can hear a certain song and it will put you in a certain mood, and that's just the beauty of music and I am so inspired by that.
My loathings are simple: stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music.
I don't need a holiday or a feast to feel grateful for my children, the sun, the moon, the roof over my head, music, and laughter, but I like to take this time to take the path of thanks less traveled.
Leaders must encourage their organizations to dance to forms of music yet to be heard.
Music is the silence between the notes.
I just want to make music, I don't want people to talk about me. All I've ever wanted to do was sing. I don't want to be a celebrity. I don't want to be in people's faces, you know, constantly on covers of magazine that I haven't even known I'm on.
Cinematography is infinite in its possibilities... much more so than music or language.
Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about.
I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.
Music is an agreeable harmony for the honor of God and the permissible delights of the soul.
Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It's part ballet. It's part battleground, part playground. We clarify, amplify and glorify the game with our footage, the narration and that music, and in the end create an inspirational piece of footage.
If being an egomaniac means I believe in what I do and in my art or music, then in that respect you can call me that... I believe in what I do, and I'll say it.
It is piracy, not overt online music stores, which is our main competitor.
A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say, 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'
Dre was one of my heros in the music industry. If he's not down for his homeboys, I don't wanna be a part of him or around him.
Rap music is the only vital form of music introduced since punk rock.
Most people live and die with their music still unplayed. They never dare to try.
Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself.
I don't know why, it's the same reason why you like some music and you don't like others. There's something about it that you like. Ultimately I don't find it's in my best interests to try and analyze it, since it's fundamentally emotional.
For I have learned to look on nature, not as in the hour of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes the still, sad music of humanity.
People haven't always been there for me, but music always has.
Music is the universal language of mankind.
Nevertheless the passions, whether violent or not, should never be so expressed as to reach the point of causing disgust; and music, even in situations of the greatest horror, should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.
Punk is not just the sound, the music. Punk is a lifestyle.
I think it's a shame when you come across young actors and musicians who haven't had the time to learn their craft. It doesn't matter if it's acting or music; you really have to learn how to do it from the bottom up because unless you have a great work ethic... fame is a terrible thing to have.
The dance can reveal everything mysterious that is hidden in music, and it has the additional merit of being human and palpable. Dancing is poetry with arms and legs.
Music rhythms are mathematical patterns. When you hear a song and your body starts moving with it, your body is doing math. The kids in their parents' garage practicing to be a band may not realize it, but they're also practicing math.
Reggae, oh man. It's the ultimate music. The positivity. The musicality. The whole cultural expressionism of it. The danceability. Just the cool factor. The melody factor. Some of it comes from a religious place. If there were a competition of who makes the best religious music, it would definitely be the Rastafarian reggae.
If I had to play only for people who liked the music because they heard it on the radio, it wouldn't make me happy. That's why I'm working so hard to have, yes, a profile as an artist, but also a profile as a DJ.
Like all music, the figured bass should have no other end and aim than the glory of God and the recreation of the soul; where this is not kept in mind there is no true music, but only an infernal clamour and ranting.
If Antarctica were music it would be Mozart. Art, and it would be Michelangelo. Literature, and it would be Shakespeare. And yet it is something even greater; the only place on earth that is still as it should be. May we never tame it.
I could compare my music to white light which contains all colours. Only a prism can divide the colours and make them appear; this prism could be the spirit of the listener.
If one plays good music, people don't listen and if one plays bad music people don't talk.
When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music. Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?
Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.
I think music is the greatest art form that exists, and I think people listen to music for different reasons, and it serves different purposes. Some of it is background music, and some of it is things that might affect a person's day, if not their life, or change an attitude. The best songs are the ones that make you feel something.
To me, the greatest pleasure of writing is not what it's about, but the inner music that words make.
Music is about listening, the more you play, the more the magic spreads.
When I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine - it kinda sucks the life out of music.
I love music of all kinds, but there's no greater music than the sound of my grandchildren laughing; my kids, too.
Like music and art, love of nature is a common language that can transcend political or social boundaries.
The spiral in a snail's shell is the same mathematically as the spiral in the Milky Way galaxy, and it's also the same mathematically as the spirals in our DNA. It's the same ratio that you'll find in very basic music that transcends cultures all over the world.
Distance doesn't exist, in fact, and neither does time. Vibrations from love or music can be felt everywhere, at all times.
Actors are agents of change. A film, a piece of theater, a piece of music, or a book can make a difference. It can change the world.
I think the most important thing about music is the sense of escape.
Music, Rock and Roll music especially, is such a generational thing. Each generation must have their own music, I had my own in my generation, you have yours, everyone I know has their own generation.
I am trying to walk a tightrope; trying to keep the DJ community happy while trying to spread the message about dance music to more people. That is the mission that I am on.
Poetry and music are very good friends. Like mommies and daddies and strawberries and cream - they go together.
There's something missing in the music industry today... and it's music. Songs you hear don't last, it's just product fed to you by the industry.
I realized that it's all really one, that John Lennon was correct. We utilize the music to bring down the walls of Berlin, to bring up the force of compassion and forgiveness and kindness between Palestines, Hebrews. Bring down the walls here in San Diego, Tijuana, Cuba.
People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.
But for the children of the poorest people we're stripping the curriculum, removing the arts and music, and drilling the children into useful labor. We're not valuing a child for the time in which she actually is a child.
Reggae has a philosophy, you know? It's not just entertainment. There's an idea behind it, a way of life behind the music, which is a positive way of life, which is a progressive way of life for better people.
Truly fertile Music, the only kind that will move us, that we shall truly appreciate, will be a Music conducive to Dream, which banishes all reason and analysis. One must not wish first to understand and then to feel. Art does not tolerate Reason.
Military justice is to justice what military music is to music.
I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'.
Back then people closed their eyes and listened to music. Today there's a lot of images that go with the music. A lot of music is crap and it's all commercial and the images are all trying to sell the record.
I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot. I've started a record label, so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music, which is a passion of mine. I've written another book. And I get to come to work and do the TV show, which is always really fun.
Those who have virtue always in their mouths, and neglect it in practice, are like a harp, which emits a sound pleasing to others, while itself is insensible of the music.
On the other hand, what I like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me. Not the demons, you understand, but the ghosts.
I feel like my music has become a lot of things. It's hard to label the evolution, but I like there to be an evolution. I just like to paint with all different kinds of colors.
Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken.
Music is mediator between spiritual and sensual life.
I love music passionately. And because I love it I try to free it from barren traditions that stifle it.
A jazz musician can improvise based on his knowledge of music. He understands how things go together. For a chef, once you have that basis, that's when cuisine is truly exciting.
Music can name the unnameable and communicate the unknowable.
Together with a culture of work, there must be a culture of leisure as gratification. To put it another way: people who work must take the time to relax, to be with their families, to enjoy themselves, read, listen to music, play a sport.
Blues and soul and jazz music has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion.
If I was just a fan of music, I would think that I was the number one artist in the world.
That's why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling, hanging out, having fun, enjoying the same music. Hip-hop is not just in the Bronx anymore. It's worldwide. Everywhere you go, people are listening to hip-hop and partying together. Hip-hop has done that.
Soul music is about longevity and reaching and touching people on a human level - and that's never going to get lost.
People think our music's very aggressive or angry or whatever, and it's just the opposite, really... I like laughing. And I like being really calm before a show, and smiley.
I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.
Hawaii is paradise. It sounds cheesy to say it, but there's music in the air there.
In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.
I will never forget experiencing Venice for the first time. It feels like you are transported to another time - the art, music, food and pure romance in the air is like no other place.
Clothes are like a good meal, a good movie, great pieces of music.
I don't live for the accolades. I'm more so about the music. Making it, and putting it out. Those are the two best feelings.
Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and... stop thinking! Just ask yourself whether the work has enabled you to 'walk about' into a hitherto unknown world. If the answer is yes, what more do you want?
Music inflames temperament.
For the introduction of a new kind of music must be shunned as imperiling the whole state; since styles of music are never disturbed without affecting the most important political institutions.
The reflection of the world is blues, that's where that part of the music is at. Then you got this other kind of music that's tryin' to come around.
Music is either sacred or secular. The sacred agrees with its dignity, and here has its greatest effect on life, an effect that remains the same through all ages and epochs. Secular music should be cheerful throughout.
Music fills the infinite between two souls.
Music is always a commentary on society.
In memory everything seems to happen to music.
Life is like music; it must be composed by ear, feeling, and instinct, not by rule.
Honestly, I don't listen to nobody else's music but my own. It's kind of like sports to me. You don't see Kobe Bryant at a LeBron James game - he just works on his own game. And that's what I do. I only listen to me, so I can criticize and analyze and all those things.
For me, great music doesn't just have to fall into one category or one genre and I love appreciating all kinds of music.
My definition of country music is really pretty simple. It's when someone sings about their life and what they know, from an authentic place.
I just hope that our fans are people who are inspired by music, and just use our music as a background or inspiration for whatever it is they do.
People like music when they're in love, but they don't need it as much. You need music when you're missing someone or you're pining for someone or you're forgetting someone or you're trying to process what just happened.
Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's style. It's doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative.
One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources, like artists, because art and music allow people a certain freedom.
A painter paints his pictures on canvas. But musicians paint their pictures on silence. We provide the music, and you provide the silence.
Music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content, and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness, as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever.
There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more.
If you pour some music on whatever's wrong, it'll sure help out.
Music - that's been my education. There's not a day that goes by that I take it for granted.
I learnt a whole lot from my mother. About music, relationships, being a good person, loving people, the whole of life. I learnt about everything from her. Every single day I think about her. All through the day.
It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music. When I heard 'Heartbreak Hotel' I thought, this is it.
Hunting, fishing, drawing, and music occupied my every moment. Cares I knew not, and cared naught about them.
The basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach: We build the social technology. They provide the music.
Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg. It's hard to say, 'That guy is less than you.' The kid is like, 'I like that guy, he's cool. How is he less than me?
Musically, New York is a big influence on me. Walk down the street for five minutes and you'll hear homeless punk rockers, people playing Caribbean music and reggae, sacred Islamic music and Latino music, so many different types of music.
Pop changes week to week, month to month. But great music is like literature.
Though everything else may appear shallow and repulsive, even the smallest task in music is so absorbing, and carries us so far away from town, country, earth, and all worldly things, that it is truly a blessed gift of God.
The Italians and Spanish, the Chinese and Vietnamese see food as part of a larger, more essential and pleasurable part of daily life. Not as an experience to be collected or bragged about - or as a ritual like filling up a car - but as something else that gives pleasure, like sex or music, or a good nap in the afternoon.
I think one of my favorite things to do is just lock myself up in a small room and listen to music and watch films for a day. Also I just like seeing my friends. We have pizza parties which means I get four friends round, we eat a pizza and we're really lazy and we play PlayStation.
The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years, and nothing is going to be able to stop it. I see absolutely no point in pretending that it's not going to happen. I'm fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years.
No two people on earth are alike, and it's got to be that way in music or it isn't music.
Disco is the first technology music. And what I mean is that 'disco' music is named after discs, because when technology grew to where they didn't need a band in the clubs, the DJ played it on a disc.
Music and the music business are two different things.
I think it's a very important collaboration between the conductor and the orchestra - especially when the conductor is one more member of the orchestra in the way that you are leading, but also respecting, feeling and building the same way for all the players to understand the music.
As long as my music is real, it's no limit to how many ears I can grab.
Music is the expression of the movement of the waters, the play of curves described by changing breezes.
I consider music to be storytelling, melody and rhythm. A lot of hip-hop has broken music down. There are no instruments and no songwriting. So you're left with just storytelling and rhythm. And the storytelling can be so braggadocious, you're just left with rhythm.
If you are a chef, no matter how good a chef you are, it's not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in cooking for others - it's the same with music.
My whole thing is just to put out positive messages in the music, give people something that can change their lives.
When I tell children that they are far too dependent on their gizmos, they do not deny it. But they really don't care. This is their real life - texting about trivial things; listening to numbing music on their private headphones. The machines block everything out - you create your own little trivial world.
I've dreamed about doing music since I was three or four years old.
Music is my life. I love doing it, so I just do it nonstop all day. And with dancing, I wanted to put on a show for people. I don't want to just be sitting there doing nothing, so that's when I started to dance.
As an architect, you have to provide a shelter to enjoy art. And you have to love art. It's like when you make a concert hall. You must love music. This is the reason why you make the space, to enjoy music - making a space for art is the same thing.
I think music is one of the hero/sheroes of the African-American existence.
I wanted to be in a punk band before I had even heard any punk music.
People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around - the music and the ideas.
Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.
Music is the best way for me to say I love you.
I want my fans to love themselves. It's almost like I want to hypnotize them so when they hear my music they love themselves instantly.
Hip-Hop isn't just music, it is also a spiritual movement of the blacks! You can't just call Hip-Hop a trend!
Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.
Good music comes out of people playing together, knowing what they want to do and going for it. You have to sweat over it and bug it to death. You can't do it by pushing buttons and watching a TV screen.
Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance... poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music.
The bass, no matter what kind of music you're playing, it just enhances the sound and makes everything sound more beautiful and full. When the bass stops, the bottom kind of drops out of everything.
When I was a teenager, I began to settle into school because I'd discovered the extracurricular activities that interested me: music and theater.
Those who seek to satisfy the mind of man by hampering it with ceremonies and music and affecting charity and devotion have lost their original nature.
I think wherever you go, when people hear good music, they will react to it.
Music has the power to make me feel good like nothing else does. It gives me some peace for a while. Takes me back to who I really am.
Beethoven can write music, thank God, but he can do nothing else on earth.
As a kid, I was into music, played guitar in a band. Then I started acting in plays in junior high school and just got lost in the puzzle of acting, the magic of it. I think it was an escape for me.
Those who decide to use leisure as a means of mental development, who love good music, good books, good pictures, good plays, good company, good conversation - what are they? They are the happiest people in the world.
A lot of music is mathematics. It's balance.
Life is like music, it must be composed by ear, feeling and instinct, not by rule. Nevertheless one had better know the rules, for they sometimes guide in doubtful cases, though not often.
I sought my father in the world of the black musician, because it contained wisdom, experience, sadness and loneliness. I was not ever interested in the music of boys. From my youngest years, I was interested in the music of men.
So long as the human spirit thrives on this planet, music in some living form will accompany and sustain it and give it expressive meaning.
The trouble with music appreciation in general is that people are taught to have too much respect for music they should be taught to love it instead.
If you don't die of thirst, there are blessings in the desert. You can be pulled into limitlessness, which we all yearn for, or you can do the beauty of minutiae, the scrimshaw of tiny and precise. The sky is your ocean, and the crystal silence will uplift you like great gospel music, or Neil Young.
The best music is essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.
Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity. So it's like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left.
Music is sunshine. Like sunshine, music is a powerful force that can instantly and almost chemically change your entire mood. Music gives us new energy and a stronger sense of purpose.
I know what I've done for music, but don't call me a legend. Just call me Miles Davis.
Singing is just a feeling set to music.
I've always wanted to be a DJ so I could play the music I love for other people. That feeling hasn't changed, but my sets are always evolving. In terms of tailoring to a specific crowd, certainly I do play differently depending on the situation. It's a different feel, for example, in a small club versus a festival.
I realised a long time ago that instrumental music speaks a lot more clearly than English, Spanish, Yiddish, Swahili, any other language. Pure melody goes outside time.
Music is like girlfriends to me; I'm continually astonished by the choices other people make.
If you copy, it means you're working without any real feeling. No two people on earth are alike, and it's got to be that way in music or it isn't music.
Thank you so much for supporting me from the day I stepped foot into the music industry. It really means something to me to have Maya Angelou speak on my behalf. It also means a lot to have Oprah on my speed dial!
Realistically, English is a universal language; it's the number one language for music and for communicating with the rest of the world.
I find Indian music very funky. I mean it's very soulful, with their own kind of blues. But it's the only other school on the planet that develops improvisation to the high degree that you find in jazz music. So we have a lot of common ground.
I quit high school on my birthday. It was my senior year and I didn't see the point. This was 1962, and I was ready to make music.
Reggae music is not an easy music to like when it comes to the power in society. 'Cause it talks about changing society. You won't find it readily accepted.
It is better to make a piece of music than to perform one, better to perform one than to listen to one, better to listen to one than to misuse it as a means of distraction, entertainment, or acquisition of 'culture.'
I don't even know what words to use to talk about the music industry anymore. But the business has changed a lot - the methods of releasing music.
If anyone asks you what kind of music you play, tell him 'pop.' Don't tell him 'rock'n'roll' or they won't even let you in the hotel.
It's funny how the music industry is enraged about the Internet and the way things are copied without being paid for. But you know why people steal the music? Because they can't afford the music.
Music washes away the dust of every day life.
Music is the arithmetic of sounds as optics is the geometry of light.
Hip-hop and electronic music are so similar, in the fact that they're both very visceral, have so much bass; a lot of times, it's the same tempos. The culture and some of the sound design is different but a lot of times, it's the same stuff.
Music is really driving my whole life.
Motown was about music for all people - white and black, blue and green, cops and the robbers. I was reluctant to have our music alienate anyone.
With few exceptions, music has been for some centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the reproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in musical sound.
A painter, who finds no satisfaction in mere representation, however artistic, in his longing to express his inner life, cannot but envy the ease with which music, the most non-material of the arts today, achieves this end. He naturally seeks to apply the methods of music to his own art.
Jazz music is to be played sweet, soft, plenty rhythm.
When I first began choreographing, I never thought of it as choreography but as expressing feelings. Though every piece is different, they are all trying to get at certain things that are difficult to put into words. In the work, everything belongs to everything else - the music, the set, the movement and whatever is said.
Philosophy is the highest music.
My goal is to be one with the music. I just dedicate my whole life to this art.
Music makes me high on stage, and that's the truth. It's like being almost addicted to music.

All the good music has already been written by people with wigs and stuff.
Music with dinner is an insult both to the cook and the violinist.

I love music. It's freedom, a way to deal with pent-up frustration.
I would love to continue in music, with writing... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant. If that happens, I will bow down gracefully, raise my kids, and have a garden. And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older. I don't need to be blonde when I'm 60!
All I do is play music and golf - which one do you want me to give up?
The music is all. People should die for it. People are dying for everything else, so why not the music?
I love to play music. So why endanger that with something like drugs?
I would love to sign on to do a movie if it was the right role and if it was the right script, because I would be taking time away from music to tell a big grand story, and spend all of my time and pouring all of my emotions into being someone else. So for me to do that, it would have to be a story worth telling.
I've always felt music is the only way to give an instantaneous moment the feel of slow motion. To romanticise it and glorify it and give it a soundtrack and a rhythm.

Music is the doorway that has led me to drawing, photography, and writing.
There's a great enthusiasm for good country music all over the world.
I am happy to make money. I want to make more money, make more music, eat Big Macs and drink Budweisers.
A lot of country music is sad. I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times. It applies to music. Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is. There is a lot of heartache in the world.
I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend.
When music fails to agree to the ear, to soothe the ear and the heart and the senses, then it has missed the point.
At the age when Bengali youth almost inevitably writes poetry, I was listening to European classical music.
Music is probably the only real magic I have encountered in my life. There's not some trick involved with it. It's pure and it's real. It moves, it heals, it communicates and does all these incredible things.
Singing is a way of releasing an emotion that you sometimes can't portray when you're acting. And music moves your soul, so music is the source of the most intense emotions you can feel. When you hear a song and you're acting it's incredible. But when you're singing a song and you're acting it's even more incredible.
Music fathoms the sky.
Music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness.
I don't want to limit myself musically. It would be really limiting if we'd neglect something we really want to do, like explore other styles of music.
I think the amazing thing about gospel music is that not only does it lift up the death and resurrection of our Lord, which is consistent with the Gospel, but it is uniquely communicated depending upon the generation.
The truest expression of a people is in its dances and its music. Bodies never lie.
Music is for people. The word 'pop' is simply short for popular. It means that people like it. I'm just a normal jerk who happens to make music. As long as my brain and fingers work, I'm cool.
The prospect of music being detachable from time and place meant that one could start to think of music as a part of one's furniture.
It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?
I don't have any real spirituality in my life - I'm kind of an atheist - but when music can take me to the highest heights, it's almost like a spiritual feeling. It fills that void for me.
Michael Jordan changed so much in basketball, he took his power to make a difference. It's so much going on in music right now and somebody has to make a difference.
Music is given to us with the sole purpose of establishing an order in things, including, and particularly, the coordination between man and time.
I'm starting to wonder if pop culture is in its dying days, because everyone is able to customize their own lives with the images they want to see and the words they want to read and the music they listen to. You don't have the broader trends like you used to.
When you're thirteen and listening to punk, the aggressive nature of music can sway you to the dark side.
When I act, I hear it like music. In my head, I hear the dialogue like music.
It would no doubt be very sentimental to argue - but I would argue it nevertheless - that the peculiar combination of joy and sadness in bell music - both of clock chimes, and of change-ringing - is very typical of England. It is of a piece with the irony in which English people habitually address one another.
Metal is still the biggest music now in America.
My music is about being strong, even in your vulnerability.
Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.
What makes my approach special is that I do different things. I do jazz, blues, country music and so forth. I do them all, like a good utility man.
I love rock-n-roll. I think it's an exciting art form. It's revolutionary. Still revolutionary and it changed people. It changed their hearts. But yeah, even rock-n-roll has a lot of rubbish, really bad music.
Sound as medium has an incredible elasticity. So, of course, it is tempting for artists of other fields to try something with sounds. Why not? We are living in the age when there is no limit in gathering all forms of art and music to mix it together if you so desire.
I've been trying to learn how to not be so conflicted about things like my own anger. I've always had a place in my music for my anger as a way of compensating for not having a mechanism to express it in my everyday life. So I've been trying to be more true to myself, and that helps me to chill out a little bit. But politically, uh-uh. No.
We're musicians. We make music for a living. It's that simple. Nothing else matters.
I mean, the shoe - there is a music to it, there is attitude, there is sound, it's a movement. Clothes - it's a different story. There are a million things I'd rather do before designing clothes: directing, landscaping.
I write music with an exclamation point!
I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.
Country music is three chords and the truth.
I don't care what people say about my relationship; I don't care what they say about my boobs. People are buying my songs; I have a sold-out tour. I'm getting incredible feedback from my music.
Dreams do come true, even for someone who couldn't speak English and never had a music lesson or much of an education.
There are certain things in which mediocrity is not to be endured, such as poetry, music, painting, public speaking.
About myself I have no great illusions. I know what I am. I know what I'm good at. I know what I ain't. I'm always hoping to surprise myself. But I do have a love of music and I do love to communicate it, and that's the best I can do, really. And I can raise a good family, too.
Music is one of the most essential things in life. It is what teaches us.
I enjoy being happy every day, and hopefully you can hear my happiness in my music. Life is beautiful.
My favorite books, art pieces, films, and music, always have something jarring about them.
There's been a shift: Country music is popular music now. Every other genre wants to come over to our land.
I love jazz music and sad music. I'm a sentimental guy. I'm a romantic guy.
The tango is really a combination of many cultures, though it eventually became the national music of Argentina.
Art makes us human, music makes us human, and I deeply feel that science makes us human.
I dabbled in things like Howlin' Wolf, Cream and Led Zeppelin, but when I heard Son House and Robert Johnson, it blew my mind. It was something I'd been missing my whole life. That music made me discard everything else and just get down to the soul and honesty of the blues.
Pop music thrives on repetition. You know a song's a hit when you've heard it so often that you'll be happy never to hear it again.
But however measurable, there is much more life in music than mathematics or logic ever dreamed of.
That was a time when I did love music, I couldn't get enough of what was going on. Maybe it was Nirvana that brought me back. I guess it was a comfort because something that sounded so right - and non-commercial - had become so influential, so immediately.
No other human being, no woman, no poem or music, book or painting can replace alcohol in its power to give man the illusion of real creation.
I've been all over the world. I love New York, I love Paris, San Francisco, so many places. But there's no place like New Orleans. It's got the best food. It's got the best music. It's got the best people. It's got the most fun stuff to do.
Even in the most beautiful music there are some silences, which are there so we can witness the importance of silence.
I don't know if One Direction will stand the test of time. I have a niece who goes crazy for them. But the only way to judge art is to wait and see if it becomes evergreen. This takes a bit of time. Adele is a very good musician and I'd like to sing with her. But, again, time will tell if her music will become evergreen.
Yet, it ought to be obvious that good music generally occupies a higher plane that mere politics. Great writers can express moods through melody and capture experiences we share most powerfully - love, lust, longing; joy, rage, fear; triumph, yearning and confusion.
Pop music, disco music, and heavy metal music is about shutting out the tensions of life, putting it away.
Because the blues is the basis of most American music in the 20th century. It's a 12-bar form that's played by jazz, bluegrass and country musicians. It has a rhythmic vocabulary that's been used by rock n' roll. It's related to spirituals, and even the American fiddle tradition.
Dope never helped anybody sing better or play music better or do anything better. All dope can do for you is kill you - and kill you the long, slow, hard way.
I really didn't try to make an effort to make urban music, but I am a product of my inspirations.
Music is therapy for me. It's my outlet for every negative thing I've ever been through. It lets me turn something bad into something beautiful.
The world's most famous and popular language is music.
Music creates order out of chaos: for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the divergent, melody imposes continuity upon the disjointed, and harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous.
Advertising, music, atmospheres, subliminal messages and films can have an impact on our emotional life, and we cannot control it because we are not even conscious of it.
My masters are strange folk with very little care for music in them.
Ah, reality TV: where opportunists delight in exposing opportunism! It's kind of like the indie music scene.
I have no love for myself as a human being, but I have immense pride in the music I make.
Is it not the business of the conductor to convey to the public in its dramatic form the central idea of a composition; and how can he convey that idea successfully if he does not enter heart and soul into the life of the music and the tale it unfolds?
Country music is important to me, and I love it, but it's not my whole life.
Science is, rightly, searching for drugs to arrest ageing or to slow the advance of dementia. But the evidence suggests that many of the most powerful factors determining how you age come from what you do, and what you do with others: whether you work, whether you play music, whether you have regular visitors.
I hope people half my age and twice my age will listen to my music - I want it to live forever and for my audience to feel like they have a friend in my music. Music is a spirit. It heals. It's an amazing thing to be loved and appreciated, and sometimes, music has not just been my best friend, it's been my only friend.
There hasn't been anything real since grunge. That was the last movement led by music or an art form.
I went to college on a classical piano scholarship. My grandmother made me practice one full hour a day. Every day. Man. I thought all she wanted was for me not to have any fun. Next thing you know, you have a career in music. Now, not everybody's going to go on and be Mozart or Michael Jackson. But music makes you smarter.
The singer-songwriter has always played music that was stylistically rooted in the '30s and the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. But the fact of the matter is that none of us remember the Depression firsthand.
Had I not come out with an inspirational CD, you perhaps would have never known that I feel like I feel, that all songs, all the music I've ever done is a gift from God.
Violence is a part of America. I don't want to single out rap music. Let's be honest. America's the most violent country in the history of the world, that's just the way it is. We're all affected by it.
Hip-hop is the streets. Hip-hop is a couple of elements that it comes from back in the days... that feel of music with urgency that speaks to you. It speaks to your livelihood and it's not compromised. It's blunt. It's raw, straight off the street - from the beat to the voice to the words.
Film is one of the three universal languages, the other two: mathematics and music.
I don't really believe in the type of pressure that people are wanting to put on the type of music that I make.
If I know you're very good in music, I can predict with just about zero accuracy whether you're going to be good or bad in other things.
Music evokes so many feelings in us, memories, nostalgia, things that are connected to our past.
I know this will blow your mind, but most people would probably never ever get it, but I listen to classical music when nobody else is around. It calms me down and I can get into this, like, deep thinking mode, you know, because there's really no lyrics to it, so you're not following something that - that you're listening to a story.
I've always thought of music as something which gives the words their flight and their wings and the music often comes first, although sometimes I'll have a concept, a title idea, a lyric idea that I want to write and the lyric will come first.
To me there is no picture so beautiful as smiling, bright-eyed, happy children; no music so sweet as their clear and ringing laughter.
Maybe we've been brainwashed by 130 years of Yankee history, but Southern identity now has more to do with food, accents, manners, music than the Confederate past. It's something that's open to both races, a variety of ethnic groups and people who move here.
I wanted to be a cheerleader, like my sister was - all the most popular and beautiful girls are cheerleaders and I wanted that, and it demolished this vision of myself. That's when I found the piano, when music saved me; that's when I first attempted to write my own songs.
What can a pencil do for all of us? Amazing things. It can write transcendent poetry, uplifting music, or life-changing equations; it can sketch the future, give life to untold beauty, and communicate the full-force of our love and aspirations.
One of the good things about globalization is it has created a single international music community, and I feel very much part of it.
Mathematics is the music of reason.
When I'm with my wife, I know she's a beautiful woman. I know that, and more than that, it's what she is inside. She's beautiful inside; she loves music like I do. That's the thing that brought us together and probably keeps us together.
I'm a serious aficionada of country music - Reba McEntire, Toby Keith, Montgomery Gentry. I've even written some songs. They haven't done anything of mine yet. But it's only a matter of time.
I alone of English writers have consciously set myself to make music out of what I may call the sound of sense.

I try to use my music to move these people to act.
Of all the music that reached farthest into heaven, it is the beating of a loving heart.
The opera is to music what a bawdy house is to a cathedral.
Folk music is a bunch of fat people.
Medicine to produce health must examine disease; and music, to create harmony must investigate discord.
Music is the melody whose text is the world.
Music is amazing. There's some metaphysical comfort where it allows you to be isolated and alone while telling you that you are not alone... truly, the only cure for sadness is to share it with someone else.
Poetry fettered, fetters the human race. Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry, painting, and music are destroyed or flourish.
I enjoy all forms of music - pop, classical and opera.
Death is the king of this world: 'Tis his park where he breeds life to feed him. Cries of pain are music for his banquet.
What I know is my music gets blamed for school shootings.
The martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth.
Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.
My aim is just to make good music every single time.
Music is a beautiful opiate, if you don't take it too seriously.
I think I first realized I wanted to be in country music and be an artist when I was 10. And I started dragging my parents to festivals, and fairs, and karaoke contests, and I did that for about a year before I came to Nashville for the first time. I was 11 and I had this demo CD of me singing Dixie Chicks and Leanne Rimes songs.
Certainly tolerance and acceptance were at the forefront of my music.
Avant-garde music is sort of research music. You're glad someone's done it but you don't necessarily want to listen to it.
For me, 'risky' is revealing what really happened in my life through music. Risky is writing confessional songs and telling the true story about a person with enough details so everyone knows who that person is.
Music is spiritual. The music business is not.
In essence, String Theory describes space and time, matter and energy, gravity and light, indeed all of God's creation... as music.
I don't understand why the press is so interested in speculating about my appearance, anyway. What does my face have to do with my music or my dancing?
Through literacy you can begin to see the universe. Through music you can reach anybody. Between the two there is you, unstoppable.
I feel good about being able to take bluegrass on to television like 'Letterman' and 'The View,' and I've heard nice things about being able to do that. I really haven't felt any negativity toward me or my music.
I think the drummer should sit back there and play some drums, and never mind about the tunes. Just get up there and wail behind whoever is sitting up there playing the solo. And this is what is lacking, definitely lacking in music today.
There's people making babies to my music. That's nice.
Rock and roll music - the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms.
I think there's nothing better than seeing a three-chord straight up rock 'n' roll band in your face with sweaty music and three minute good songs.
What I've discovered is that in art, as in music, there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth, but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for, my moment. It's the moment that the audience falls in love.
First of all, the music that people call Latin or Spanish is really African. So Black people need to get the credit for that.
Adult life is dealing with an enormous amount of questions that don't have answers. So I let the mystery settle into my music. I don't deny anything, I don't advocate anything, I just live with it.
I want my music to do the explaining.
The earth has grown old with its burden of care, but at Christmas it always is young, the heart of the jewel burns lustrous and fair, and its soul full of music breaks the air, when the song of angels is sung.
Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music.
I had no desire to be famous; I just wanted to make the greatest music ever made. I didn't want anyone to know who I was.
It had never occurred to me before that music and thinking are so much alike. In fact you could say music is another way of thinking, or maybe thinking is another kind of music.
The only things Mick and I disagree about is the band, the music and what we do.
Music is a lady that I still love because she gives me the air that I breathe. We need all sorts of nourishment. And music satisfies and nourishes the hunger within ourselves for connection and harmony.
Placebo is music for outsiders, by outsiders and our gigs are like conventions of outcasts, which is cool.
Music's always been really cathartic. It's the best drug for me to get away from the everyday pressures just for a second via a good song.
There are a lot of bands who claim to be punk and they only play the music, they have no clue what it's all about. It's a lifestyle. It's not about popularity and all that crap.
I turned to music originally because of my past and needing a release or an outlet to get out anger or frustration or hurt.
Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music.
For me, music and life are all about style.
I didn't want to go out and change anything. I just wanted to make the music that was part of my background, which was rock and blues and hip-hop.
Music of all arts should be expansive and inclusive.
I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing, and it's not corny. I think I can grow as an artist, and my fans will grow with me.
When superstition is allowed to perform the task of old age in dulling the human temperament, we can say goodbye to all excellence in poetry, in painting, and in music.
Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.
I'm such an avid magazine reader - music, art, beauty magazines - and I found that food and restaurants were pouring into everything I cared about. Whether it was the pop-up concept, or some mysterious mini-mall restaurant, I got swept up in the sexy romance of the food movement.
Music has always been my back door to life. It is important for people to find something that excites them. I like the concept that if you do what excites you, you will be rewarded generously, whatever form reward takes, which is not necessarily money.
As hard as it is, as ghetto as it is, hip-hop is pop music. It's the sound of music getting out of the ghetto, while rock is looking for a ghetto.
I was irrevocably betrothed to laughter, the sound of which has always seemed to me the most civilised music in the world.
Music is made one of Satan's most attractive agencies to ensnare souls; but, when turned to a good account, it is a blessing. When abused, it leads the unconsecrated to pride, vanity, and folly.
You can't give up something you really believe in for financial reasons. If you die by the roadside - so be it. But at least you know you've tried. Ten minutes in the music scene was the equal of one hundred years outside of it.
I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.'
Inspiration for my music just comes from, you know, my life experiences.
One and the same thing can at the same time be good, bad, and indifferent, e.g., music is good to the melancholy, bad to those who mourn, and neither good nor bad to the deaf.
Some of the greatest blues music is some of the darkest music you've ever heard.
In 'thinking up' music I usually have some kind of a brass band with wings on it in back of my mind.
Learning music by reading about it is like making love by mail.
If I hadn't had music in my life, it's quite possible I'd be dead and I'd much rather be alive.
You can't really imagine music without technology.
I'm into sincerity in music and sincerity in art. If it doesn't feel true, I don't want to do it. Things that are too dramatic scare me. I think that's why I don't always fit into the world of performing arts.
Big companies are like marching bands. Even if half the band is playing random notes, it still sounds kind of like music. The concealment of failure is built into them.
My horizon on humanity is enlarged by reading the writers of poems, seeing a painting, listening to some music, some opera, which has nothing at all to do with a volatile human condition or struggle or whatever. It enriches me as a human being.
I know it sounds corny, but when you follow your dreams, it happens. And if it's music, take it seriously.
Rap music's been around for too long now to be inspirational. The words are, but the music isn't.
Music was important. Football was the easy part.
The whole history of pop music had rested on the first person singular, with occasional intrusions of the second person singular.
It is so characteristic, that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved, there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played.
You can't fake this music. You might be a great singer or a great musician but, in the need, that's got nothing to do with it. It's how you connect to the songs and to the history behind them.
I travel the garden of music, thru inspiration. It's a large, very large garden, seen?
If children are not introduced to music at an early age, I believe something fundamental is actually being taken from them.
Yes, there are times when I get extremely depressed and how I sublimate those feelings is through music.
I love country music, blues, and punk, and one day I might make those kinds of records.
Inspiring music may fill the soul with heavenly thoughts, move one to righteous action, or speak peace to the soul.
If I put a value on my music, and no one's prepared to pay that, then more fool me, but the idea that the value is created by the consumer is an idiot plan; it can't work.
I always believed that my work should be unfinished in the sense that I encourage people to add their creativity to it, either conceptually or physically. Back in the 1960s, I was calling for 'Unfinished Music,' number one, and number two, with my artwork - I was taking unfinished work into the gallery. And that's how I was looking at it.
Music is your guide.
Gospel music is never pessimistic, it's never 'oh my god, its all going down the tubes', like the blues often is.
Gospel music rhythms are not African in origin, although I know that's what the jazz experts say.
The best music, you can seek some shelter in it momentarily, but it's essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.
When I was younger, studying classical music, I really had to put in the time. Three hours a day is not even nice - you have to put in six.
When I grew up, what was interesting for me was that music was color and life was gray. So music for me has always been more than entertainment.
Linguistic philosophers continue to argue that probably music is not a language, that is in the philosophical debate. Another point of view is to say that music is a very profound language.
There is still a future with music, because people want music.
Music my rampart, and my only one.
I'm not one who divides music, dance or art into various categories. Either something works, or it doesn't.
Musicians are there in front of you, and the spectators sense their tension, which is not the case when you're listening to a record. Your attention is more relaxed. The emotional aspect is more important in live music.
Indie music is 'it' now. It's kind of a revolution to the music: 1980s, 1990s music was getting very sanitized; they were complying with the music industry. Music was getting more and more dead in a way. Now, because of the social climate that's very severe, the artists are compelled to start being real. It's really great that indie music is now.
I've been composing music all my life and if I'd been clever enough at school I would like to have gone to music college.
The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie.
Popular music formed the soundtrack of my life.
The way I feel about music is that there is no right and wrong. Only true and false.
I was never too keen on the British music press. They've called us a supermarket hype, and they used to suggest that we didn't write our own songs.
Words make you think a thought. Music makes you feel a feeling. A song makes you feel a thought.
I liberate minds with my music. That's more important than liberating a few people from apartheid or whatever.
I mean, the genuine roots of culture is folk music.
Music has generally involved a lot of awkward contraptions, a certain amount of heavy lifting.
I'm not trying to keep up or adapt. I'm allowing myself to grow, evolve and create new music.
With music, you often don't have to translate it. It just affects you, and you don't know why.
I think that prog rock is the science fiction of music. Science fiction speculates on what the future might be and look like and how we'll get there, and yet there's always a central theme of humanity, or there should be. Progressive rock has the same concept of exploration into the parts of the music world that hasn't been explored.
I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living emotionally - with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a certain point, with your children.
I don't care what people say. My music's, my music.
To me, movies and music go hand in hand. When I'm writing a script, one of the first things I do is find the music I'm going to play for the opening sequence.
I loved 'Fantasia' as a kid because it filled me with wonder, enchantment and awe. It was my first real introduction into classical music. It was totally inspiring to me.
I have a sort of tactility about music. I go into record stores and just run my fingers over it, the spines.
In the future, you won't buy artists' works; you'll buy software that makes original pieces of 'their' works, or that recreates their way of looking at things. You could buy a Shostakovich box, or you could buy a Brahms box. You might want some Shostakovich slow-movement-like music to be generated. So then you use that box.
Records were vitally important to the development of music and of all music cultures. With that being pushed by the wayside, I can't see an iPod uniting us. In fact it separates us, the streets are full of people bumping into lamp posts, listening to their own little universe, and there's no sharing in that.
Before recording technology existed, you could not separate music from its social context.
I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines, you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.
It's true that I have a wide range of interests. I like to write and paint and make music and go walking on my own and garden. In fact, gardening is probably what I enjoy doing more than anything else.
Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.
I'm proud to be a railway modeler. It means more to me to be on the cover of Model Railroader than to be on the cover of a music magazine.
Music has as many roles as people make it.
I'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I've always had a huge soundtrack album collection. So what I do, as I'm writing a movie, is go through all those songs, trying to find good songs for fights, or good pieces of music to layer into the film.
Everything I was feeling, all the hurt and the pain and the emotion I was going through, I put into my music.
Yoga is almost like music in a way; there's no end to it.
I feel like once the song is done, you put it out there and if people want to do bizarre remixes, if people want to make strange videos, great. You know, like chaos theory applied to the music business.
I do believe that music has an intense power to connect us together, to inspire us to become ourselves.
The music industry is a strange combination of having real and intangible assets: pop bands are brand names in themselves, and at a given stage in their careers their name alone can practically gaurantee hit records.
To be an artist, you don't have to compose music or paint or be in the movies or write books. It's just a way of living. It has to do with paying attention, remembering, filtering what you see and answering back, participating in life.
I'm writing constantly about all my crazy experiences across the world, so I have a lot of music I've already written.
Music's been around a long time, and there's going to be music long after Ray Charles is dead. I just want to make my mark, leave something musically good behind. If it's a big record, that's the frosting on the cake, but music's the main meal.
Punk was originally about creating new, important, energetic music that would hopefully threaten the status quo and the stupidity of the 1970s.
I do listen to music. Movie scores, exclusively, because it's all about mood and nonspecificity. I love the way modern movie scoring is all about nonspecificity. You know, if I shuffled the tracks from 'Inception,' I challenge you to tell me which is which.
Music can be healing, and with my history and my knowledge of both sides of what looks like a gigantic divide in the world, I feel I can point a way forward to our common humanity again.
To me, John Lennon and Elvis Presley were punks, because they made music that evoked those emotions in people.
I love making music and I'm falling in love with making records, so it's like having two girlfriends. But I can handle it.
Music is the language of the heart, and conservatives always screw it up.
I found that when I was putting my own music out, with my Twitter feed as the pure marketing budget, I'm preaching to the choir.
When music is allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it is a terrible curse. Young people assemble together to sing, and, although professed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their frivolous conversation and their choice of music.
Rich Mullins was the uneasy conscience of Christian music. He didn't live like a star. He'd taken a vow of poverty so that what he earned could be used to help others.
I like music that's more offensive. I like it to sound like nails on a blackboard, get me wild.
There's a constantly applicable nature to soul music, whereas sometimes pop music can be a periodical.
I like playing music because it's a good living and I get satisfaction from it. But I can't feed my family with satisfaction.
Music, not sex, got me aroused.
When I signed that major-label contract when I was 20 years old. I did it because I wanted to play music for the rest of my life. That's every 20-year-old's dream - to do whatever the hell you want.
I'm going to keep on finding out the kind of man I am through my music. That's the one place I can be free. But the reason it's difficult is because I'm changing all the time.
I heard someone from the music business saying they are no longer looking for talent, they want people with a certain look and a willingness to cooperate.
Creativity and artistic endeavors have a mission that goes far beyond just making music for the sake of music.
The English may not like music, but they absolutely love the noise it makes.
I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something. I think, if anything, the press kind of, because of my gender and my age, tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It's part of the cultural dynamic, I guess.
If you can use a search engine, you can find any piece of music that's been recorded for free. I'm not saying that's right, but it's a fact, and I'm surprised that more people don't accept or acknowledge that and try to adapt in some way.
In TV, film, and music there's a lot of snobbery, and I don't like it. I've never been a cultural snob.
As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theater. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that.
Music became a healer for me.
Anything that keeps you happy and writing is part of my writing ritual: I like music, so I tend to have it playing in the background. But if I'm interested, I can write in an airport waiting areas.
A lot of pop music is about stealing pocket money from children.
I feel a part of the congregation. I've never had to do special music. The kids sing in the choir. It's just normal. We're treated like everybody else.
I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.
In a sense, the music business and I haven't always been the best of bedfellows. Artists often have to fight their corner. Your music goes through these filters of record labels and media, and you're hoping you'll find someone who'll help you get your work into the world.
My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.
We were raised in an Italian-American household, although we didn't speak Italian in the house. We were very proud of being Italian, and had Italian music, ate Italian food.
The beautiful thing about hip-hop is it's like an audio collage. You can take any form of music and do it in a hip-hop way and it'll be a hip-hop song. That's the only music you can do that with.
There weren't a lot of career opportunities in crazy-fast hardcore punk, so you didn't have a lot of ambition, just the love and passion to play music with your friends.
Music is the greatest communication in the world. Even if people don't understand the language that you're singing in, they still know good music when they hear it.
For me, playwriting is and has always been like making a chair. Your concerns are balance, form, timing, lights, space, music. If you don't have these essentials, you might as well be writing a theoretical essay, not a play.
My thing is related to who I am as a person. The clothes are an extension of me. The music is an extension of me. All my businesses are part of the culture, so I have to stay true to whatever I'm feeling at the time, whatever direction I'm heading in. And hopefully, everyone follows.
With pop music, the format dictates the form to a big degree. Just think of the pop single. It has endured as a form even in the download age because bands conform to a strict format, and work, often very productively, within the parameters.
I hear music that comes out of need, out of grief, sorrow, suffering and out of overcoming these things, as well. That journey to freedom still goes on today. It's an incremental change, the culmination of many events in your own life and the lives of your children and grandchildren.
When I started getting so many haters and closed doors, I decided to prove that it could be done. I was a divorced single mother of three at the time and a size 12 - not your typical model artist that labels feel work for the music industry.
All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.
Music is music, ultimately. If it makes you feel good, cool.
From the beginning, I knew intuitively that if nothing else, music was safe, and that nobody could tell me anything about it. Music didn't need a middleman, whereas all the other things in school needed some kind of explanation.
Film music should have the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading.
I never saw music in terms of men and women or black and white. There was just cool and uncool.
Singing is a way of releasing an emotion that you sometimes can't portray when you're acting. And music moves your soul, so music is the source of the most intense emotions you can feel.
Music will never go away, and I will never stop making music; it's just what capacity or what arena you decide to do it.
Bob Marley is a huge influence. I love reggae music, but I also love the purpose of the songs he writes and the style of the music - it takes your worries away and makes you feel good, and I think that's what music is about.
Since I was a kid, I've had an absolute obsession with particular kinds of American music. Mississippi Delta blues of the Thirties, Chicago blues of the Fifties, West Coast music of the mid-Sixties - but I'd never really touched on dark Americana.
Music was always the distraction, so it was the obvious choice to pursue. My dad always said to find a job I love to do, that way it wouldn't feel like a job. So I did that.
I wanna show that gospel, country, blues, rhythm and blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll are all just really one thing. Those are the American music and that is the American culture.
The key to longevity is to learn every aspect of music that you can.
My symphonies would have reached Opus 100 if I had but written them down... Sometimes I am so full of music, and so overflowing with melody, that I find it simply impossible to write down anything.
It's glorious to be able to go onto the Internet and hear any kind of music anywhere, from anywhere, and get it instantly. But there's also something glorious about having a record with a sleeve and looking at the artwork, putting it on the turntable and playing it, there's still something romantic to me about that.
You have to watch all sides of your advancement, you have to make sure people's bodies and minds are healthy and their morale is cool before you can really go out and play great music.
Music is in my DNA!
If you have some magical chemistry that actually find the music you make compelling, that is a big bonus.
One of the things I love about music is live performance.
But an innovation, to grow organically from within, has to be based on an intact tradition, so our idea is to bring together musicians who represent all these traditions, in workshops, festivals, and concerts, to see how we can connect with each other in music.
If you're in the middle of the ocean with no flippers and no life preserver and you hear a helicopter, this is music. You have to adjust to your needs at the moment.
Sometimes words are just music themselves. Like 'Chicago' is a very musical sounding name.
I feel that when you care about your music, taking risks is something you should do to keep things exciting.
There is hardly any money interest in art, and music will be there when money is gone.
Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.
It is jazz music that called me to be a musician and I have always sang the songs that moved me the most. Singers, like Frank Sinatra and myself, we interpret the songs that we like. Not unlike a Shakespearean actor that goes back to the greatest words ever written, we go back to the greatest songs.
I'd love to do my own music for sure. I'd love to have a band.
Look at music for what it's worth around the world and not just America. In other countries, people are still buying CDs and going to record stores. But in America, it's all about digital. The game is breaking down. But, look at me, you need to know how to play the game the right way.
Music is my therapy and my straitjacket. Music keeps me sane and keeps my mind on something. It's fragile up there.
Richard Wagner, a musician who wrote music which is better than it sounds.
I feel like I'm a product of this generation where everybody listens to charts with diverse music.
I think some people would say that I do overwhelm the words with the music, and sometimes thank goodness I do.
And what classical music does best and must always do more, is to show this kind of transformation of moods, to show a very wide psychological voyage. And I think that's something that we as classical musicians have underestimated.
Being honest is my job. That's what music is for me.
What is this? It's music to get a brain seizure by.
My first memories of music were country music and Ronnie Milsap. Where I grew up, it was what you listened to. And anything else, you were somewhat out of place.
I hope to refine music, study it, try to find some area that I can unlock. I don't quite know how to explain it but it's there. These can't be the only notes in the world, there's got to be other notes some place, in some dimension, between the cracks on the piano keys.
I just love music gear, I'm a total geek all around.
The universe is a symphony of strings, and the mind of God that Einstein eloquently wrote about for thirty years would be cosmic music resonating through eleven-dimensional hyper space.
When I joined Nirvana, I was the fifth or sixth drummer - I don't know if they'd ever had a drummer they were totally happy with. And they were strangers. There was never much of a deeper connection outside of the music.
I think music follows the trends of the collective conscious.
I wonder if anyone else has an ear so tuned and sharpened as I have, to detect the music, not of the spheres, but of earth, subtleties of major and minor chord that the wind strikes upon the tree branches. Have you ever heard the earth breathe?
Classical music and pop are two different universes, each with its own difficulties, peculiarities, depth and artistic dignity. In Italy, I think there is a fairly clear line of demarcation, but the history of music is full of fusion. Popular and classical music have always found points of contact, of crossing, exchange, both drawing mutual profit.
Acting is largely about putting on masks, and music is about removing them.
I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.
Poetry is plucking at the heartstrings, and making music with them.
The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness.
It's nice being friends over a period of time with people whose music you like so much, or other filmmakers, seeing people change, go through trials.
I write the vocals last, because I wanted to invent the music first and push the music to the level that I had to compete against it.
Losing my sight had nothing to do with my focus on music. My passion for music was already there, so it would be a mistake to give too much significance to my blindness.
Music truly is the universal language.
Half of the modern world goes back as far as Pearl Jam. The real historians go back to U2. But they need to go back further. They have to go back to the '50s and '60s, where things started. That's how you get to be your own personality, by studying the masters. Rock and roll was white kids trying to make black music and failing, gloriously!
I got obsessed with classical music, I got obsessed with Chopin, with playing the piano.
You know when you throw a party, you think people will show up and no one will like each other. It's like that with music - parts of your musical psyche have never met other parts. You wonder if you should get them together.
Saxophone is one thing, and music is another.
People often complain that music is too ambiguous, that what they should think when they hear it is so unclear, whereas everyone understands words. With me, it is exactly the opposite, and not only with regard to an entire speech but also with individual words.
I've grown to love California: It's the dream of every English musician to come here and work in the sunshine. To walk up Sunset Boulevard, knowing you're going to make music - that's it.
I think it's awesome to see people of all different ages from all kinds of backgrounds come together for the love of music.
But then when he left, I realized that it was harder to write songs and feel spiritually connected to art and music as a band. When he came back I felt it again, instantaneously.
Music's supposed to come from the heart. I felt like that if it ever got mechanical, I was going to back away from it.
I was trying to uphold what I thought feminism was as best I could by supporting women, by trying to create an opportunity to get women to get together, play music together and celebrate the fact that we are having great success making music on our own and together.
Music is all of a sudden much more colorful.
Like sunshine, music is a powerful force that can instantly and almost chemically change your entire mood.
Growing up listening to rap music, you almost feel like you should have haters. That's an important part of being a successful musician. It's a good thing, I guess.
I defied the machinery to make me its slave. Its incessant discords could not drown the music of my thoughts if I would let them fly high enough.
What came to me as a revelation was the use of rhythm in developing an overall structure in music.
I think all those artists are artists who are appreciated because you believe their words and you appreciate their honesty in their music. If you don't appreciate the honesty in the music, the beat can be fly as hell but you'll never give an emcee props.
My musical influence is really from my father. He was a DJ in college. My parents met at New York University. So he listened to, you know, Motown, and he listened to Bob Dylan. He listened to Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones, but he also listened to reggae music. And he collected vinyl.
I'd like a male to listen to my music and find it kind of fascinating, what a girl goes through when they get heartbroken or get sad or get hurt by something.
I find that, maybe because I'm also a singer, I hear music in characters all the time, even if they don't sing. I hear what affects me in my heart.
My earliest memories of rap music was mixed with my earliest memories of reggae music. They were big sounds around the way, heavy bass lines, strong messages, definitely.
Everything comes out in blues music: joy, pain, struggle. Blues is affirmation with absolute elegance. It's about a man and a woman. So the pain and the struggle in the blues is that universal pain that comes from having your heart broken. Most blues songs are not about social statements.
I want to write music that's going to appeal to everyone.
I tried to take heavy metal... and balled it up and chopped it in half and really tried to create a new form of energy. I really tried to re-shape extreme music as I see it through my eyes.
To me, country music's about life. It's about Monday through Friday. It's the blue-collar, 40-hour week, songs about life. It used to have more of a sound, but I think the heart of that's still the same. It's still American music.
I just want to make the best music of all time with my best friends.
I have pictures of me sitting in the racquetball court in my pajamas with an acoustic guitar, and Wolfgang is probably just two-and-a-half-feet tall. I'll never forget the day I saw his foot tapping along in beat! I knew then, I couldn't wait for the day I'd be able to make music with my son. I don't know what more I could ask for.
My mother's songs are really turning out to be masterpieces. I have inherited this incredible legacy and am so fortunate to bathe in her sensibilities. It is tinged with tragedy. I'd much rather she was here in person, but there is still a positive force to come out of her death and that is having the gift of music that she gave.
It's pretty cool to see how far music can take you.
In World War II, jazz absolutely was the music of freedom, and then in the Cold War, behind the Iron Curtain, same thing. It was all underground, but they needed the food of freedom that jazz offered.
My dedication to my music has driven everyone away. I've had girlfriends, but I always end up on my own. I don't particularly like it, but I don't see a way 'round it.
The conception of background music is changing. You use less and less of it these days.
I think the feelings in my music were suggested to me before I even had the ability to play music.
When I heard Elvis Presley, then I knew I had to do music. Music is my god, and is the only love that has never left me. It has always been there and is my best friend.
I'm a country singer. I love all kinds of music, but country is where my loyalty lies. That's just me and what I do, and I'm not going to change it.
With rock music, the amount of power that you can generate, the intensity behind the intentions of your lyrics that you can really reflect through rock music - you can't do that in jazz. You can't do that with classical.
My story of success and failure is not just about music and being famous. It's about living and loving and trying to find purpose in this crazy world.
I love making music, though. I love playing.
At the end of the '90s and into 2000, electronic music was still an underground phenomenon, especially in America.
I think music has the power to transform people, and in doing so, it has the power to transform situations - some large and some small.
Not only did I get an A in music but I got an A in ladies.
I was about sixteen when I discovered that music could get you laid, so I got into music boy, didn't matter what you looked like either, you could be a geeky looking guy but if you played music, whoa, you'd get the girls.
The music is the message, the message is the music. So that's my little ministry that the Big Man upstairs gave to me - a little ministry called love and happiness.
I remember rap music. We used to party and dance off of it. Today it's all about a whole different angle... Rappers are going against each other, and it's more of a bragging, boasting thing.
Recording in Jamaica is like nothing else. The studios are always closed in America. But in Jamaica, the studio doors are wide open, and there's music blasting out in the street. You can see the reaction of people immediately.
I'm into fashion because it contains the mood of the day, of the moment - like music, literature, and art.
What I look for in music is artistry, sincerity, and simplicity, and Tom Waits has all of that. I want to make a connection to the creator.
Everybody, no matter what vocation they're looking at, should add music as an essential to their curriculum. Music can be a very important part of your soul and your growth as a human being. It's so powerful.
I think of a piece of music as something that comes alive when it is being performed, and I feel that my role in the transmission of music is to be its best advocate at that moment.
Rap music is amazing, it's beautiful. But the problem is the lyrics. The person who writes the lyrics - that's the problem.
I feel like soundtrack music is almost like seeing the movie again, but with my ears.
I'm trying to be me and embrace all the parts of me that have grown up, listened to more music and soaked up more influences.
It's really about making the best music you can make. It's really about working hard.
I remain loyal to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert in music and to Shakespeare and Jane Austen in literature.
An intelligent person feels guilty for downloading music without paying the musician, but they use this free-open-culture ideology to cover it.
My secret ambition was always to provide music for animation films: something with an Indian theme, either a fairy tale or mythological tale or on the Krishna theme. I still have a very deep desire, but these sorts of chances don't always come.
Cuba is such a beautiful country, and everywhere you go, there's music and people dancing - especially in Havana.
Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.
I'm a fan of all these genres of music, everything from Mumford &amp; Sons to Beach Boys to doo-wop music to reggae.
I've always made music that was representative of real life.
Being a professional musician doesn't mean you spend 12 hours a day playing music. It means you spend up to 12 hours a day taking care of business, dealing with litigation, with the various characters who've stolen your interests, or fending off hostile lawsuits from former members of the band.
I think music should be experienced by people all ages.
The show business has all phases and grades of dignity, from the exhibition of a monkey to the exposition of that highest art in music or the drama which secures for the gifted artists a world-wide fame princes well might envy.
It was so wonderful outside that even the wild senselessness of this enormous death, whose music I hear again and again, could not disturb me from my great enjoyment!
The one thing I wanted to do more than anything else was sing country music.
The Beach Boys are not a superstar group. The music is the superstar of the group.
I have a great body, I really do. But I want to be taken seriously as an artist, and wearing anything that shows it off will be a distraction from the music. That's how my signature uniform, my tuxedo, came about. It's classic and timeless. You'll see me in black, white, and a pop of color on my lips. That pop adds a little magic.
As a musician usually music is your way out.
Trance is a very emotional and uplifting form of dance music. It appeals to many people in this way having such a strong connection with emotions. It makes people happy and ready to party.
A translation is no translation, he said, unless it will give you the music of a poem along with the words of it.
Music is a powerful tool in galvanizing people around an issue. There's no better way to get your point across than to put it in a beautiful song.
It is one thing to record an album but it's a huge difference when people play it and listen to it and embrace it the way that I do. It has always been my dream to get my music out to the world and have people hear it.
You know, traditional country music is something that's going to be around forever.
I never set out to be part of a genre, because I listen to all types of music.
'The Beatles' did whatever they wanted. They were a collection of influences adapted to songs they wanted to write. George Harrison was instrumental in bringing in Indian music. Paul McCartney was a huge Little Richard fan. John Lennon was into minimalist aggressive rock.
I dare suggest that the composer would do himself and his music an immediate and eventual service by total, resolute and voluntary withdrawal from this public world to one of private performance and electronic media.
My music is a luxury.
The fame and the money and all that stuff that comes along with it is all great, but that's not the sole purpose of why I make music.
Once I accomplish one thing and I'm satisfied, I try something else. I may be 50 and doing something totally outside of music and acting. Maybe I'll become a kindergarten teacher.
My music has a very spiritual background, a sanctity that is almost like worship.
There is something comforting about going into a practice room, putting your sheet music on a stand and playing Bach over and over again.
There are only two things: love, all sorts of love, with pretty girls, and the music of New Orleans or Duke Ellington. Everything else ought to go, because everything else is ugly.

Being in Blur has allowed me to travel and hear the music that's being made all over the world.
You can fill this table up with people who are racist, homophobic, Satanist worshippers, sexist and we can be arguing but if you put on a song, I guarantee that people will stop and listen and that's what I love about music, it can bring people together.
I have always been far more interested in sound than technique, and how sounds work together, how they can be layered. I think electronic music, in its infancy anyway, allowed us to create music in a way that hadn't really been possible before. It created a new kind of musician.
It's not that people don't like classical music. It's that they don't have the chance to understand and to experience it.
That's what drew me to rock music in the first place - that sense of remaking the world on your own terms.
Music at times is more like perfume than mathematics.

Music is art to me, and you don't censor art. You don't go into a museum and censor things.
Music is such an important part of my life.
I just try to play music from my heart and bring as much beauty as I can to as many people as I can. Just give them other alternatives, especially people who aren't exposed to creative music.
STREET by 50 is all about giving our fans the finest music experience we possibly can. The response to the limited edition colors so far speaks for itself - the fans want the opportunity to match their headphones to their personal style, and we definitely want to make sure to give them what they want.
The Internet is both great and terrible. As a source of information, a tool for delivering music and art, it's great. But spamming ads and piracy of music is terrible. It's stealing.
I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba - 'Lana Del Rey' reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.
I adore watching movies; movie marathons are my favorite pastime. I can watch up to five movies back to back. I also love music and like reading whenever I get the time.
To stop the flow of music would be like the stopping of time itself, incredible and inconceivable.
I think we're returning to more of the original vibration of music and creativity through the removal of this distortion called the music industry. That's where we're heading. And it'll cut out a lot of music if people ever expected to make money.
I grew up overseas in Indonesia, and my school had a great art, music, and theatre program.
We love not just Judas Priest music, but we love heavy metal and we love to get out on that stage every night and perform. It's a joy to be able to do it.
It's hard to decide how to match words to music. It's not like it's twice the work. It's always difficult for me to explain to the composer what I'm looking for. I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music.
Ballroom is two people dancing together to music, touching in perfect harmony.
Music is something that's always been a huge part of my life.
I've looked at pictures that my mom has of me, from when I was four years old at the turntable. I'm there, reaching up to play the records. I feel like I was bred to do what I do. I've been into music, and listening to music and critiquing it, my whole life.
You can be creative in anything - in math, science, engineering, philosophy - as much as you can in music or in painting or in dance.
One thing that really appeals to me is this idea of music being a living thing that has an evolution that, in a way, enables the artist to sell a process rather than a piece of product.
Music, as many people have said, is the universal language. Of course points are made which make you think about things, but ultimately it makes you feel. And that's why people remember more songs that have meant something during their life than films. They start to define periods in your life, and that's kind of the beauty of it.
The end of all good music is to affect the soul.
There's nothing better than live music. It's raw energy, and raw energy feeds the soul.
And so for a couple of years my life was divided between my music and my school books.
Singing is my passion, my first love and the secret of my energy. Music to me is like finding my inner self, my soul. It gives me a great joy to see audiences enjoying with me. I have given my heart to singing. When I sing, I can feel romance in everything around me.
If a guy's got it, let him give it. I'm selling music, not prejudice.
Describing Woodstock as the 'big bang,' I think that's a great way to describe it, because the important thing about it wasn't how many people were there or that it was a lot of truly wonderful music that got played.
I grew up thinking art was pictures until I got into music and found I was an artist and didn't paint.
Napster works because people who love music share and participate.
Essentially my contribution was to introduce repetition into Western music as the main ingredient without any melody over it, without anything just repeated patterns, musical patterns.
My mum was never strict. I was allowed to go out to clubs underage, watch TV, listen to whatever music I wanted to, and that made me not rebel. I have never touched a drug in my life.
I agree with you about the music of today. It lacks style and emotion.
Composing music is hard work.
As a youngster, I never dreamed there could be a career actually earning a living writing music.
Napster hijacked our music without asking. They never sought our permission. Our catalog of music simply became available as free downloads on the Napster system.
Because of piracy there has been a massive downturn in people buying music, which makes it more difficult for artists to make money from the sale of records.
A name doesn't make the music. It's just called that to differentiate it from other types of music.
I think music can really affect people's emotions and, when I am about to get into a race car, I definitely listen to music with a good beat - that's when you've got the adrenalin pumping. And the time before you go into a race weekend, you have a lot of emotion and adrenalin, and a lot of focus.
If something happened where I couldn't write music anymore, it would kill me. It's not just a job. It's not just a hobby. It's why I get up in the morning.
I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.
Music has shaped men's fashion, and transposed in a playful and witty manner its riding or military heritage. It is difficult to figure out who leads, but music and fashion are connected genetically.
Jazz music and, more specifically, jazz musicians, are my artistic heroes. I want to be the Thelonious Monk of acting. He had no concern for how well he was received. He played whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. He just wasn't interested in achieving the good opinion of his audience. That's the Holy Grail of acting; of any art form.
New Orleans is unlike any city in America. Its cultural diversity is woven into the food, the music, the architecture - even the local superstitions. It's a sensory experience on all levels and there's a story lurking around every corner.
Music is the medicine of the mind.
When my time ends, I want people to say, 'Man her music made me smile; it just enlightened my life; it inspired me; it made me feel good every time.'
Normally, things are viewed in these little segmented boxes. There's classical, and then there's jazz; romantic, and then there's baroque. I find that very dissatisfying. I was trying to find the thread that connects one type of music - one type of musician - to another, and to follow that thread in some kind of natural, evolutionary way.
My music is jazz.
Color is everywhere, so everything has changed. I still can't see color, but I can perceive it. I can experience it in a way that allows me to be a part of this reality, which I was excluded from before. Thanks to the eyeborg, I've made a career by combining music and art.

With me poetry has not been a purpose, but a passion.

Poetry is finer and more philosophical than history; for poetry expresses the universal, and history only the particular.
I liked to write from the time I was about 12 or 13. I loved to read. And since I only spoke to my brother, I would write down my thoughts.

If my poetry aims to achieve anything, it's to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel.
The dance can reveal everything mysterious that is hidden in music, and it has the additional merit of being human and palpable. Dancing is poetry with arms and legs.
I know some people might think it odd - unworthy even - for me to have written a cookbook, but I make no apologies. The U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins thought I had demeaned myself by writing poetry for Hallmark Cards, but I am the people's poet so I write for the people.
I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.

If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.

Poetry is the one place where people can speak their original human mind. It is the outlet for people to say in public what is known in private.
Poetry should help, not only to refine the language of the time, but to prevent it from changing too rapidly.

The business of the poet is not to find new emotions, but to use the ordinary ones and, in working them up into poetry, to express feelings which are not in actual emotions at all.
When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.
Poetry, even when apparently most fantastic, is always a revolt against artifice, a revolt, in a sense, against actuality.
Poetry is not only dream and vision; it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.

Poetry isn't a profession, it's a way of life. It's an empty basket; you put your life into it and make something out of that.
Poetry is simply the most beautiful, impressive, and widely effective mode of saying things.
Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does.
There are men who can write poetry, and there are men who can read balance sheets. The men who can read balance sheets cannot write.
To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.
I wrote some of the worst poetry west from the Mississippi River, but I wrote. And I finally sometimes got it right.
Superstition is the poetry of life.
Poetry has done enough when it charms, but prose must also convince.
Poetry may make us from time to time a little more aware of the deeper, unnamed feelings which form the substratum of our being, to which we rarely penetrate; for our lives are mostly a constant evasion of ourselves.
Poetry surrounds us everywhere, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it.
Why should poetry have to make sense?
It's bad poetry executed by people that can't sing. That's my definition of Rap.
Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.

Everything is complicated; if that were not so, life and poetry and everything else would be a bore.
I came to poetry through the urgent need to denounce injustice, exploitation, humiliation. I know that's not enough to change the world. But to remain silent would have been a kind of intolerable complicity.
Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber's wax dummy is to sculpture.
Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.
There are certain things in which mediocrity is not to be endured, such as poetry, music, painting, public speaking.
I'm fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there's a lot of poetry in it. There's a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you'd better listen to it pretty carefully, 'cause it's important.
Money is a kind of poetry.
I have piles of poetry books in the bathroom, on the stairs, everywhere. The only way to write poetry is to read it.
In a meadow full of flowers, you cannot walk through and breathe those smells and see all those colors and remain angry. We have to support the beauty, the poetry, of life.

Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether, the trick they miss is that being called this thing, with the weight of tradition behind it, and with the association of the Royal family, does allow you to have conversations and to open doors, and wallets, for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.
Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.

The completely solitary self: that's where poetry comes from, and it gets isolated by crisis, and those crises are often very intimate also.
Every now and then I read a poem that does touch something in me, but I never turn to poetry for solace or pleasure in the way that I throw myself into prose.

You know, people speak in poetry all the time. They just don't realize it.
It's always a combination of physics and poetry that I find inspiring. It's hard to wrap your head around things like the Hubble scope.
Poetry is the work of poets, not of peoples or communities; artistic creation can never be anything but the production of an individual mind.
Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep watch over my thoughts, because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act.
Romance like a ghost escapes touching; it is always where you are not, not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time, but it is poetry in the memory.
The only thing that can save the world is the reclaiming of the awareness of the world. That's what poetry does.
Literature is a state of culture, poetry is a state of grace, before and after culture.
The growth of art seems to be in cycles, and often its vigorous lifetime is restricted to a century or two.

Poetry is truth in its Sunday clothes.
I do not see how a man can work on the frontiers of physics and write poetry at the same time. They are in opposition.

Poetry is above all a concentration of the power of language, which is the power of our ultimate relationship to everything in the universe.
Everyone sort of sees his own life and times as being ephemeral. One thinks that everything good or important that happened, happened in the past.

I joined the army on my seventeenth birthday, full of the romance of war after having read a lot of World War I British poetry and having seen a lot of post-World War II films. I thought the romantic presentations of war influenced my joining and my presentation of war to my younger siblings.
As human beings, we are the only organisms that create for the sheer stupid pleasure of doing so. Whether it's laying out a garden, composing a new tune on the piano, writing a bit of poetry, manipulating a digital photo, redecorating a room, or inventing a new chili recipe - we are happiest when we are creating.
Poetry; a criticism of life under the conditions fixed for such a criticism by the laws of poetic truth and poetic beauty.

I have been enlightened. I have fallen into poetry and it has swallowed me up.
But it is the province of religion, of philosophy, of pure poetry only, to go beyond life, beyond time, into eternity.
Plagiarism has been around far longer than the Internet. In fact, I had a poem published in 'Seventeen' magazine when I was 15 years old. About a year later I was informed that there was a girl who used that same poem to win a statewide poetry competition in Alabama. It took months for people to put together that this had happened.
Too many people in the modern world view poetry as a luxury, not a necessity like petrol. But to me it's the oil of life.
Often people, when they're confronted with a poem, it's like someone who keep saying 'what is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this?' And that dulls us to the other pleasures poetry offers.
I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.
One of the things I've always liked about my husband is he's very good at lots of stuff. He was an English teacher when I met him. He wrote poetry and played the guitar. As time went on, he decided to go into economics, so he's very analytical and mathematical in addition to his artsy side.
I read poetry to save time.

Poetry is something to make us wiser and better, by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth, which God has set in all men's souls.
Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by singularity, it should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.

The crown of literature is poetry.
Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject.

Poetry comes from the highest happiness or the deepest sorrow.
I felt like my favorite writers have almost musical hooks in their work, whether it's poetry or a hook at the end of a chapter that makes you want to read the next one. And I think that my favorite writers definitely have something musical about what they do, in saying something so relatable and universal and so simple.
The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.
You will not find poetry anywhere unless you bring some of it with you.
In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.

I am two fools, I know, for loving, and for saying so in whining poetry.
Poetry is as precise a thing as geometry.

All one's inventions are true, you can be sure of that. Poetry is as exact a science as geometry.
A verbal art like poetry is reflective; it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.

Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it.
Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.

Poetry remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art.
Every American poet feels that the whole responsibility for contemporary poetry has fallen upon his shoulders, that he is a literary aristocracy of one.

I gave up on new poetry myself 30 years ago when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens in a hostile world.
As an actor, there is room for a certain amount of creativity, but you're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else's words. I don't think I'd have the stamina, skill or ability to write a novel, but I'd love to write short stories and poetry, because those are my two passions.
I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose = words in their best order; - poetry = the best words in the best order.

When you're going through something, whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody, you often feel like 'Oh my God, I'm so overwhelmed; I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.' In fact, poetry's a nice reminder that, no, everybody goes through it. These are universal experiences.
A grain of poetry suffices to season a century.
Poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward; it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.

Poetry is adolescence fermented, and thus preserved.
We explore our environment, more than we are compelled to utter poetry, when we're toddlers. We start doing that later. Before that happens, every child is a scientist.

Few rappers realize the genre sprang from West African griots through Delta slave songs to jazz poetry and the comedic trash talk of 'the dozens.'

Poetry and beauty are always making peace. When you read something beautiful you find coexistence; it breaks walls down.
I came into music because I thought the presentation of poetry wasn't vibrant enough. So I merged improvised poetry with basic rock chords.
Poetry is not a matter of feelings, it is a matter of language. It is language which creates feelings.
In poetry, you must love the words, the ideas and the images and rhythms with all your capacity to love anything at all.
Poetry is a political act because it involves telling the truth.
The genesis of a poem for me is usually a cluster of words. The only good metaphor I can think of is a scientific one: dipping a thread into a supersaturated solution to induce crystal formation. I don't think I solve problems in my poetry; I think I uncover the problems.
I don't think of poetry as a 'rational' activity but as an aural one. My poems usually begin with words or phrases which appeal more because of their sound than their meaning, and the movement and phrasing of a poem are very important to me.

Poetry is something I love to do. Good poetry has an amazing ability to be communicative before it's even understood. I get emotional just from the beauty of words.

If food is poetry, is not poetry also food?
I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn't that spectacular.

I credit poetry for making this space-walk possible.
What other people may find in poetry or art museums, I find in the flight of a good drive.
I think the first time I really heard poetry was in the schoolyard. Just the little limericks that kids say when they're jumping rope and playing games. I think that's the first time I heard rhyming words - I don't know if I'd call that the definitive poetry, but that's when I heard rhyming words said and not necessarily sung.
I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.

There is something about poetry beyond prose logic, there is mystery in it, not to be explained but admired.
In fact, in lyric poetry, truthfulness becomes recognizable as a ring of truth within the medium itself.
Like most lit nerds, I'm a voracious reader. I never got enough poetry under my belt growing up but I do read it - some of my favorites, Gina Franco and Angela Shaw and Cornelius Eady and Kevin Young, remind me daily that unless the words sing and dance, what's the use of putting them down on paper.
I am grateful for - though I can't keep up with - the flood of articles, theses, and textbooks that mean to share insight concerning the nature of poetry.
Romantic poetry had its heyday when people like Lord Byron were kicking it large. But you try and make a living as a poet today, and you'll find it's very different!
A play is basically a long, formalistic polemic. You can write it without the poetry, and if you do, you may have a pretty good play. We know this because we see plays in translation. Not many people speak Norwegian or Danish or whatever guys like Ibsen spoke, or Russian - yet we understand Chekhov and the others.
Composers need words, but they do not necessarily need poetry. The Russian composer, Aleksandr Mossolov, who chose texts from newspaper small ads, had a good point to make. With revolutionary music, any text can be set to work.
Marriage - a book of which the first chapter is written in poetry and the remaining chapters in prose.
I want people to bow as they see me and say he is gifted with poetry, he has seen the presence of the creator.
Freedom is poetry, taking liberties with words, breaking the rules of normal speech, violating common sense. Freedom is violence.
Written poetry is worth reading once, and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others.
In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's existence in this world.
The great function of poetry is to give back to us the situations of our dreams.
But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.
Poetry is like a bird, it ignores all frontiers.
I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting.
I did not have a very literary background. I came to poetry from the sciences and mathematics, and also through an interest in Japanese and Chinese poetry in translation.
One difference between poetry and lyrics is that lyrics sort of fade into the background. They fade on the page and live on the stage when set to music.
Metaphorical tone deafness is when people are unable to discern what is of value in something. I think I'm tone deaf to poetry, for instance. Despite having studied it into a second year of university, most of it just leaves me cold.
For my part, if I consider poetry as an object, I maintain that it is born of the necessity of adding a vocal sound (speech) to the hammering of the first tribal music.
Poetry and consumption are the most flattering of diseases.
Poetry is the art which is technically within the grasp of everyone: a piece of paper and a pencil and one is ready.
Drawing is a way of coming upon the connection between things, just like metaphor in poetry reconnects what has become separated.
I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went.
Poetry is my cheap means of transportation. By the end of the poem the reader should be in a different place from where he started. I would like him to be slightly disoriented at the end, like I drove him outside of town at night and dropped him off in a cornfield.
This proves that great lyric poetry can die, be reborn, die again, but will always remain one of the most outstanding creations of the human soul.
The poetry that sustains me is when I feel that, for a minute, the clouds have parted and I've seen ecstasy or something.
You can find poetry in your everyday life, your memory, in what people say on the bus, in the news, or just what's in your heart.
Poetry and prayer are very similar.
Everyone needs solitude, especially a person who is used to thinking about what she experiences. Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.
English poetry begins whenever we decide to say the modern English language begins, and it extends as far as we decide to say that the English language extends.
What is more beautiful than a sea of water with a number of white-winged boats skirting its surface? Poetry and beauty contesting with the wind and the waves!
To different minds, poetry may present different phases. To me, the reverent faith of the people I lived among, and their faithful everyday living, was poetry; blossoms and trees and blue shies were poetry. God himself was poetry.
Poetry is life distilled.
I have published in 'The New Yorker,' 'Holiday,' 'Life,' 'Mademoiselle,' 'American Heritage,' 'Horizon,' 'The Ladies Home Journal,' 'The Kenyon Review,' 'The Sewanee Review,' 'Poetry,' 'Botteghe Oscure,' the 'Atlantic Monthly,' 'Harper's.'
Poetry, I think, intensifies the reader's experience. If it's a humorous facet of the story, poetry makes it more exuberant. If it's a sad facet, poetry can make it more poignant.
My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. Figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject. But I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time.
Poetry is a mere drug, Sir.
I think that the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time.
I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity. Your father being killed, for instance, is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he's going to write poetry or songs.
Instead of trying to come up and pontificate on what literature is, you need to talk with children, to teachers, and make sure they get poetry in the curriculum early.
With several different kinds of poetry to choose from, a man would decide that he would like best to be an epic poet, and he would set out, in conscious determination, on an epic poem.
Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life.
I think that one possible definition of our modern culture is that it is one in which nine-tenths of our intellectuals can't read any poetry.
Eloquence is the poetry of prose.

And anyway, Anglo-Saxon is a different language, which has to be learned.
One of the things that is wonderful about hymns is that they are a sort of universally shared poetry, at least among certain populations.

The poem is not, as someone put it, deflective of entry. But the real question is, 'What happens to the reader once he or she gets inside the poem?'

It is the timber of poetry that wears most surely, and there is no timber that has not strong roots among the clay and worms.

The sources of poetry are in the spirit seeking completeness.
I have experienced healing through other writers' poetry, but there's no way I can sit down to write in the hope a poem will have healing potential. If I do, I'll write a bad poem.

I certainly derived my skills as a prose writer from my scrutiny of poetry and of the individual word. But schools don't do things like that anymore - tracking words down to their roots.

Thomas Davis was a great man where poetry is concerned, and a better than Thomas Moore. All over Ireland his poetry is, and he would have done other things but that he died young.
I really enjoy English and poetry and writing classes.
The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.
I recently read that it's the left brain that does all that calculating, and the right brain that does the poetry. Somehow I've veered way towards the left. I've been doing it for years. Maybe I do art to balance it out.
Becoming interested in poetics got me interested in theater. Theater is supposed to be poetry, you know, before it's anything else. It just doesn't fly if it isn't musical.
The mystical poetry of William Blake's artwork also forms the basis for the album cover.
Lyric poetry is, of course, musical in origin. I do know that what happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it began to be written for the page. When it's a question of typography, why not? Poets have done beautiful things with typography - Apollinaire's 'Calligrammes,' that sort of thing.
Modernism in other arts brought extreme difficulty. In poetry, the characteristic difficulty imported under the name of modernism was obscurity. But obscurity could just as easily be a quality of metrical as of free verse.
The voice is raised, and that is where poetry begins. And even today, in the prolonged aftermath of modernism, in places where 'open form' or free verse is the orthodoxy, you will find a memory of that raising of the voice in the term 'heightened speech.'
My work should be seen as poetry.
In Australia, not reading poetry is the national pastime.
If there were no poetry on any day in the world, poetry would be invented that day. For there would be an intolerable hunger.
You can be intuitive when you've got a more expansive role. You can get into the poetry of telling the story rather than just pushing buttons.
Poetry privileges music and is aesthetically more challenging. Prose privileges information and is emotionally more challenging.
Prose cannot compete with the economy of poetry, the ability to have a full artistic experience in a short period of time.
I was very interested in American poetry for many years. Much less now.
I like poetry when I don't quite understand why I like it. Poetry isn't just a question of wrapping something up and giving it to someone else to unwrap. It just doesn't work like that.
Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.
In the world of poetry there are would-be poets, workshop poets, promising poets, lovesick poets, university poets, and a few real poets.
The office of poetry is not to make us think accurately, but feel truly.
Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.
I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write.
Pound's translation of Chinese poetry was maybe the most important thing I read. Eliot a little bit later.
Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.
I don't think the creative writing industry has helped American poetry.
A poem in form still has to have voice, gesture, a sense of discovery, a metaphoric connection, as any poetry does.
I learned to impersonate the kind of person that talks about poetry. It comes from teaching, I think.
Sometimes poetry, it is incomprehensible. But we need incomprehensible stuff! It is very healthy to talk about incomprehensible things! It is very healthy! We need it!
I don't like to boast, but I have probably skipped more poetry than any other person of my age and weight in this country.
Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.
I cannot speak for more than an hour exclusively about poetry. At that point, life itself takes over again.
Poetic talent doesn't operate in a vacuum. There is a spirit of Polish poetry.
Poetry, being supremely useless, by its very existence represents a protest against the so-called 'real world' of busy-ness and moneymaking, so we must embrace, salute and support our poets.
I have to admit that I had a lot of problems with poetry.
I wrote poetry, which got me into lyrics. Stevie Wonder, Carole King, Elton John pulled me into pop. I started singing with a band - just for fun - when I was 17. And pretty soon, I was thinking I could sing pop in English as well as Spanish.
Great poetry does not have to be technically intricate.
Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral.
One problem we face comes from the lack of any agreed sense of how we should be working to train ourselves to write poetry.
When I was in college, I used to write little ditties and short stories and poetry for my friends. Writing a book is another thing. It is so much different from my traditional day of dirty fingernails and greasy hair and hot pans.
When we study Shakespeare on the page, for academic purposes, we may require all kinds of help. Generally, we read him in modern spelling and with modern punctuation, and with notes. But any poetry that is performed - from song lyric to tragic speech - must make its point, as it were, without reference back.
The lines of poetry, the period of prose, and even the texts of Scripture most frequently recollected and quoted, are those which are felt to be preeminently musical.
I actually remember celebrating National Poetry Day at school; I remember having to write and read a load.
He passes from lyric to epic poetry in order to speak about the world and the torment in the world through man, rationally and emotionally. The poet then becomes a danger.
The poetry of heroism appeals irresistibly to those who don't go to a war, and even more to those whom the war is making enormously wealthy. It's always so.
Poetry is a form of mathematics, a highly rigorous relationship with words.
I'm not a great poetry fan.
However, poetry does not live solely in books or in school anthologies.
With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people, and even do it in advance and get their response. It's difficult with iPad: how do you send it out for free, and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store?
When I rap, I get to express myself in a way where putting words together is like poetry, and sometimes it's better to talk in certain expressions than sing, you know? So I love, I love to rhyme when I want to express certain things.
My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother's into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.
Have you ever heard a good joke? If you've ever heard someone just right, with the right pacing, then you're already on the way to poetry. It's about using words in very precise ways and using gesture.
I think one of the things that people tend to forget is that poets do write out of life. It isn't some set piece that then gets put up on the shelf, but that the impetus, the real instigation for poetry is everything that's happening around us.
Nothing is too small. Nothing is too, quote-unquote, ordinary or insignificant. Those are the things that make up the measure of our days, and they're the things that sustain us. And they're the things that certainly can become worthy of poetry.
I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.
If epic poetry is a definite species, the sagas do not fall within it.
The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.
Poetry is a street fighter. It has sharp elbows. It can look after itself. Poetry can't be used for manipulation; it's why you never see good poetry in advertising.
Poetry is for me Eucharistic. You take someone else's suffering into your body, their passion comes into your body, and in doing that you commune, you take communion, you make a community with others.
And the second question, can poetry be taught? I didn't think so.
I never think about poetry except when I'm writing it. I mean my poetry.
When I was asked to be Writer in Residence at Edinburgh I thought, you can't teach poetry. This is ridiculous.
Without touching my subject I want to come to the moment when, through pure concentration of seeing, the composed picture becomes more made than taken. Without a descriptive caption to justify its existence, it will speak for itself - less descriptive, more creative; less informative, more suggestive - less prose, more poetry.
The same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized slaughterhouses of work are also arguing, singing, drinking, dancing, making love, holding the streets, picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry.
I read as much poetry as time allows and circumstance dictates: No heartache can pass without a little Dorothy Parker, no thunderstorm without W. H. Auden, no sleepless night without W. B. Yeats.
But one does not make living writing poetry unless you're a professor, and one frankly doesn't get a lot of girls as a poet.
I think we fool ourselves and really negate a great deal of history if we think that the oral history of poetry is shorter than the written history of poetry. It's not true. Poetry has a longer oral tradition than it does written.
I like the beauty of Faulkner's poetry. But I don't like his themes, not at all.
I'm looking for a guy who makes you want to dance and write poetry all day long.
The residue of religion in my work appears as a modified transcendentalism, and the positivist scientific side of my thought appears as concreteness and realism. The effort to reconcile the two is at the core of all my poetry.
If you don't mark your successes, the day your ship comes in could be just another day at the office, and there's no poetry in that.
I want to be the best advocate and promoter for poetry that I can be.
From the catbird seat, I've found poetry to be the necessary utterance it has always been in America.
Dismissals of poetry are nothing new. It's easy to dismiss poetry if one has not read much of it.
The experience of poetry could bring my mother back to me. Poetry offers a different kind of solace - here on earth.
I think there is a poem out there for everyone, to be an entrance into the poetry and a relationship with it.
I think poetry's always a kind of faith. It is the kind that I have.
Poetry's a thing that belongs to everyone.
I've been most happy to be an advocate for the kinds of grassroots things that people are doing who care about poetry.
You know, I can imagine not writing a novel and writing poetry only.
I come here to speak poetry. It will always be in the grass. It will also be necessary to bend down to hear it. It will always be too simple to be discussed in assemblies.
A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.
It takes most men five years to recover from a college education, and to learn that poetry is as vital to thinking as knowledge.
The great watershed of modern poetry is French, more than English.
Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.
The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.
What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.
Poetry has the virtue of being able to say twice as much as prose in half the time, and the drawback, if you do not give it your full attention, of seeming to say half as much in twice the time.
When I really want to be soothed and reminded of why people bother to fiddle with sentences, I often read poetry.
I love to read poetry but I haven't written anything that I'm willing to show anybody.
Journalism is concerned with events, poetry with feelings. Journalism is concerned with the look of the world, poetry with the feel of the world.
I've written poetry since I was in the first grade, and it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I realized poetry could be put to music and become a song.
America was based on a poetic vision. What will happen when it loses its poetry?
In the total darkness, poetry is still there, and it is there for you.
There is poetry even in prose, in all the great prose which is not merely utilitarian or didactic: there exist poets who write in prose or at least in more or less apparent prose; millions of poets write verses which have no connection with poetry.
I have frequently noticed in myself a tendency to a diffuse style; a disposition to push my metaphors too far, employing a multitude of words to heighten the patness of the image, and so making of it a conceit rather than a metaphor, a fault copiously illustrated in the poetry of Cowley, Waller, Donne, and others of that ilk.
Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.
I always loved singing and writing poetry. I always loved music, and I've loved writing my whole life. When I put them together, it was probably in my early 20s where I put words to music for the first time.
With Shakespeare and poetry, a new world was born. New dreams, new desires, a self consciousness was born. I desired to know to know myself in terms of the new standards set by these books.
To be under occupation, to be under siege, is not a good inspiration for poetry.
That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.
I don't think you get to good writing unless you expose yourself and your feelings. Deep songs don't come from the surface; they come from the deep down. The poetry and the songs that you are suppose to write, I believe are in your heart.
I was trained as an actress. But I wasn't a very convincing actress, so I started doing punk poetry and then fell into doing stand-up.
I spent many years of my life as an economist and demographer. I was finally distracted by writing my novels and poetry. I'm enormously happy that was the case. I feel that with writing I have found my metier.
Reading a piece of poetry with no beat in front of 20 people is way more challenging than rocking for 10,000 people.
And if they haven't got poetry in them, there's nothing you can do that will produce it.
Never fear: Thank Home, and Poetry, and the Force behind both.
I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.
Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.
I know I'm not a wordsmith. And I don't write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it's really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels.
I was a serious poet for quite a while and had little notebooks filled with poetry.
In the past, poetry came in the form of spells and chants used to effect change.
Today the U.S. is farther from being nourished by poetry than it was a hundred years ago, when books of poems were best-sellers.
The quietest poetry can be an explosion of joy.
Bleak House is just the most astounding piece of work. There's huge, visionary poetry in it.
So it is in poetry. All we ask is that the mood recorded shall impress us as having been of the kind that exhausts the imaginative capacity; if it fails to do this the failure will announce itself either in prose or in insignificant verse.
And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.
My feeling is that poetry will wither on the vine if you don't regularly come back to the simplest fundamentals of the poem: rhythm, rhyme, simple subjects - love, death, war.
Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral. Its transmission today is still in part oral, because we become acquainted with poetry through nursery rhymes, which we hear before we can read.
A glance at the history of European poetry is enough to inform us that rhyme itself is not indispensable. Latin poetry in the classical age had no use for it, and the kind of Latin poetry that does rhyme - as for instance the medieval 'Carmina Burana' - tends to be somewhat crude stuff in comparison with the classical verse that doesn't.
The iambic pentameter owes its pre-eminence in English poetry to its genius for variation. Good blank verse does not sound like a series of identically measured lines. It sounds like a series of subtle variations on the same theme.
In the writing of poetry we never know anything for sure. We will never know if we have 'trained' or 'practised' enough. We will never be able to say that we have reached grade eight, or that we have left the grades behind and are now embarked on an advanced training.
There is no gender to my music. There's no male or female voice, no trite lyrics or poetry. It's much more abstract, so it lives with you longer.
It's just poetry, beauty and love. How hard can that be to act?
A book is sent out into the world, and there is no way of fully anticipating the responses it will elicit. Consider the responses called forth by the Bible, Homer, Shakespeare - let alone contemporary poetry or a modern novel.
The poetry from the eighteenth century was prose; the prose from the seventeenth century was poetry.
There is also poetry written to be shouted in a square in front of an enthusiastic crowd. This occurs especially in countries where authoritarian regimes are in power.
So I really began as a failed poet - although when I first wanted to be a writer, I learned to write prose by reading poetry.
I can find some way to make poetry out of my life's experiences.
By the general process of epic poetry, I mean the way this form of art has constantly responded to the profound needs of the society in which it was made.
However, I learned something. I thought that if the young person, the student, has poetry in him or her, to offer them help is like offering a propeller to a bird.
It is a happy thing that there is no royal road to poetry. The world should know by this time that one cannot reach Parnassus except by flying thither.
I hardly remember how I started to write poetry. It's hard to imagine what I thought poetry could do.
Prior to Wordsworth, humor was an essential part of poetry. I mean, they don't call them Shakespeare comedies for nothing.
It's like I understand images and some people understand poetry.
Poetry is a natural energy resource of our country.It has no energy crisis, possessing a potential that will last as long as the country. Its power is equal to that of any country in the world.
While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else. And poetry won't be for everyone, but everyone should have the choice.
Poetry is also the physical self of the poet, and it is impossible to separate the poet from his poetry.
Gil Thorpe is a great diversion and is to book writing as poetry is to prose.
I definitely used to write a lot at school. Comic poetry and drawings about people.
Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.
The first thing I tried to do in the months after losing my mother was to write a poem. I found myself turning to poetry in the way so many people do - to make sense of losses. And I wrote pretty bad poems about it. But it did feel that the poem was the only place that could hold this grief.
I think I felt at some point that I couldn't understand poetry or that it was beyond me or it didn't speak to my experience. I think that was because I hadn't yet found the right poems to invite me in.
My father, Eric Trethewey, is a poet, so I had one right inside the house. And on long trips, he'd tell me, if I got bored in the car, to write a poem about it. And I did find that poetry was a way for me, I think as it for a lot of people, to articulate those things that seem hardest to say.
Even though I am the daughter of a poet, and my stepmother is also a poet, growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry; I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life, the feelings that I endured on a day-to-day basis, until I was introduced to the right poem.
I think people turn to poetry more often than they think they do, or encounter it in more ways than they think that they do. I think we forget the places that we encounter it, say, in songs or in other little bits and pieces of things that we may have remembered from childhood.
I think the biggest thing that I have to do is to remind people that poetry is there for us to turn to not only to remind us that we're not alone - for example, if we are grieving the loss of someone - but also to help us celebrate our joys. That's why so many people I know who've gotten married will have a poem read at the wedding.
'NewsHour' is very interested in poetry, but they're also interested in not just that something's cute to add on at the end of their programming, but something that actually is integrated into the news.
You have to learn a few things, which you do along the way, but basically, poetry is a matter of the ear. Iambic pentameters or what constitutes a stanza comes naturally - your ears will know.
Why do writers, say, give up a job in economics and decide to write poetry? Or, why do they give up a job in a bank and decide to paint, like Krishan Khanna? They want to convey something.
Those books of mine that are remunerative - I'm not talking about poetry here - take years to write, and I am never sure they'll be successful. So writing is a risk in more senses than one.
The tradition of Russian literature is also an eastern tradition of learning poetry and prose by heart.
Poetry operates by hints and dark suggestions. It is full of secrets and hidden formulae, like a witch's brew.
Among the American contemporaries I read with most enjoyment are several North Carolinians. I think the best poetry being written these days is being written by Southerners.
The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.
Our most famous writers are Faulkner and Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor. It would make sense that the poetry would reflect some of those same values, some of the same techniques.
The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.
I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.
One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.
The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.
Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.
The importance of poetry is not measured, finally, by what the poet says but by how he says it.
The sentences I write have their roots in song and poetry, and take their bearings from music and painting, as much as from the need to impart mere information, or mirror anything. I am not a realist writer, even if I seem like one.
From my music training, I knew that, some Spanish rhythms apart, 5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4. But if you speak lines of poetry in that pattern you just end up hitting the off-beats. It's only when you add a rest - a sixth beat - that it sounds as it surely should sound.
I like to write poetry.
Bad, quirky poetry might be better than some of the good stuff, because it really comes from the heart.
I think the best American poetry is the poetry that utilizes the resources of poetry rather than exploits the defects or triumphs of the poet's personality.
I'd like to go back to poetry again. I really, really revere good poetry. It's been my private discipline.
This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime, who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning, forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil? Do such practices represent Iran's ancient history and culture, its ethnic and religious diversity? Its centuries of sensual and subversive poetry?
Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.
Poetry always runs away from you - it's very difficult to grasp it, and every time you read it, depending on your conditions, you will have a different grasp of it. Whereas with a novel, once you have read it, you have grasped it.
My poetry is the most disappointing thing for me that I've ever written. When I say I can write everything, I don't say I can write everything well.
I'm not really one for fancy, big words and poetry, and the scriptwriters worked very hard on 'Paradise Lost' to translate it.
I've always written, all my life, and when I was very young I developed an interest in poetry.
I like the way words go together and I like the gamesmanship of writing poetry. It is such a challenge.
I don't think it's always good to read lots of poetry.
I love films. I love music. I love poetry and stories. All of that I feel... I sort of get very excited and fed by.
Distinctly American poetry is usually written in the context of one's geographic landscape, sometimes out of one's cultural myths, and often with reference to gender and race or ethnic origins.
An experienced reader uses the poem as an agent of inquiry. This makes poetry very exciting, unstable, and interactive.
Poetry is but another form of inquiry into the nature of phenomena, using with its own unique procedures and tools.
If poetry alters the way in which the reader views the world, then it has had its desired effect.
I'm quite sure that most writers would sustain real poetry if they could, but it takes devotion and talent.
On July 26, 1916, I announced to all my friends in America that from now on I resolved to write no more poems in the classical language, and to begin my experiments in writing poetry in the so-called vulgar tongue of the people.
I have been writing poetry since 1975. My first poetry book was published in 1986.
In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.
More people are reading poetry now than at any time in the history of the human race.
More people than ever are slowly but surely turning their ears toward poetry.
I was always making up rhymes. But I never thought that poetry would become my life.
We're all just animals. That's all we are, and everything else is just an elaborate justification of our instincts. That's where music comes from. And romantic poetry. And bad novels.
I did not move into developing or processing color. I stayed with black and white. I still think to this day that I prefer to work in black and white if it has to do with poetry or anything other than specific reality. I have worked in color when I thought it was the appropriate way to express the thought that I was working on.
If you go into a bar in most places in America and even say the word poetry, you'll probably get beaten up. But poetry is a really strong, beautiful form to me, and a lot of innovation in language comes from poetry.
Gradually I find that my whole soul is merging itself into this business of writing, and especially of writing poetry. I am going to try it; and am going to test, in the most rigid way I know, the awful question whether it is my vocation.
I don't write poetry and then strum some chords and then fit the words on top of the chords.
Prose talks and poetry sings.
Children can write poetry and then, unless they're poets, they stop when reach puberty.
I knew what book we had to write, it was clear in my head; it was journals and poetry. So I passed on their offer. I told my agent this is our vision, and no one's done it this way.
In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to, what they were doing, why they were doing it. They never moved me in the way that one is moved by true poetry.
If a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act.
The romanticised life, where all the great poetry and music and art of the world comes from, is great but it requires a lot of self-indulgence.
I am a writer, which means I write stories, I write novels, and I would write poetry if I knew how to. I don't want to limit myself.
Rap is rhythm and poetry. Hip-hop is storytelling and poetry as well.
I was actually a poetry major in college before I punted and decided to become a theater major. I wrote the poem that we put on the sauerkraut boxes in the style of Elling.
Poetry can't cure cancer, but it can save your life until you die.
Perhaps there is an idea among Japanese students that one general difference between Japanese and Western poetry is that the former cultivates short forms and the latter longer ones, gut this is only in part true.
I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in fiction and in poetry.
I see no reason for calling my work poetry except that there is no other category in which to put it.
Poetry is all nouns and verbs.
My father loved poetry and music. But deep in himself he thought teaching the finest thing a person could do.
All I knew about Ethiopia was from a few records that I like, as well as what I read about the famine. But you get there and it's another world. It's filled with art and music and poetry and intellectuals and writers - all kinds of people.
Poetry must be made by all and not by one.
I've been writing a lot of poetry recently. It helps me think and work things out.
A great many people seem to think writing poetry is worthwhile, even though it pays next to nothing and is not as widely read as it should be.
I work on words, mostly, toward them being poetry or short stories, and then some of those become songs. They all find their place in the world, but they all start off in the same place. I'm always painting and drawing as well, and it's an ongoing creative assignment.
I have had much to learn from Sweden's poetry and, more especially, from her lyrics of the last generation.
I don't want to bury anything in poetry.
If there's no money in poetry, neither is there poetry in money.
So now I have a collection of poetry by Aaron Neville and I give it to people I want to share it with. I'd like to publish it someday.
People wish to be poets more than they wish to write poetry, and that's a mistake. One should wish to celebrate more than one wishes to be celebrated.
On a summer night it can be lovely to sit around outside with friends after dinner and, yes, read poetry to each other. Keats and Yeats will never let you down, but it's differently exciting to read the work of poets who are still walking around out there.
American poetry, like American painting, is always personal with an emphasis on the individuality of the poet.
But I am not political in the current events sense, and I have never wanted anyone to read my poetry that way.
But I don't think that poetry is a good, to use a contemporary word, venue, for current events.
High and low culture come together in all Post Modern art, and American poetry is not excluded from this.
I definitely wish to distinguish American poetry from British or other English language poetry.
The poetry and transgression that was so much of surrealism's anarchic force has been recruited into mainstream culture. It has been made commonplace by television and magazine merchandising, by computer games and Internet visuals, by film and MTV, by the fashion shoot.
Journalism wishes to tell what it is that has happened everywhere as though the same things had happened for every man. Poetry wishes to say what it is like for any man to be himself in the presence of a particular occurrence as though only he were alone there.
So I suppose poetry, language, the shaping of it, was and remains for me an effort to make sense out of essentially senseless situations.
Written poetry is different. Best thing is to see it in performance first, then read it. Performance is more provocative.
I used to write stories and poetry, but for some reason I have it in my head that if I'm going to write, I have to write a script.
I have always written poetry but I have never applied it to songwriting.
I see people who talk about America, and then undermine it by not paying attention to its soul, to its poetry. I see polarization, reductionism and superficiality.
As to London we must console ourselves with the thought that if life outside is less poetic than it was in the days of old, inwardly its poetry is much deeper.
I've got a book of poetry by the bed, one of these big collections that goes back to the Greeks and Romans.
If our hearts are ready for anything, we are touched by the beauty and poetry and mystery that fill our world.
As for political poetry, as it's usually defined, it seems there's very little good political poetry.
Deep feeling doesn't make for good poetry. A way with language would be a bit of help.
My old teacher's definition of poetry is an attempt to understand.
Humour is a fine line to walk in poetry, as in fiction. I just think it's harder to write. It's harder to keep the respect of the reader too.
The poetry community here has been extraordinarily welcoming.
Then I discovered I loved writing poetry more than fiction.
How does one happen to write a poem: where does it come from? That is the question asked by the psychologists or the geneticists of poetry.
I'm not a writer. I think I can write short stories and poetry, but film writing, brilliant film writing, is a talent - you can't just do it like that.
There's a certain line between jokes and music and poetry that's a bit blurred in my mind.
I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.
I think that great poetry is the most interesting and complex use of the poet's language at that point in history, and so it's even more exciting when you read a poet like Yeats, almost 100 years old now, and you think that perhaps no one can really top that.
Poetry has always been made to seem kind of cultish. But the truth is, everybody really loves it! It's much more mainstream than anyone thought.
Publishing the lyric books, poetry or comics of other musicians I know. That's the thing I really want to break into!
Religion is no more possible without prayer than poetry without language, or music without atmosphere.
There's a fierce practicality and empiricism which the whole imaginative, lyrical aspect of poetry comes from.
I come from a short fiction background, and my mom is a poet, so I've always read poetry; I've always had a lot of different influences both linguistically and musically.
The middle class is doing fine in fiction. But it's not what gets me going. I love the working class, and everyone from it I've met, and think they're incredibly witty, inventive - there's a lot of poetry there.
Poetry had great powers over me from my childhood, and today the poems live in my memory which I read at the age of 7 or 8 years and which drove me to desperate attempts at imitation.
There is the view that poetry should improve your life. I think people confuse it with the Salvation Army.
I've been writing since I was 10 or 11. I started with poetry because that was the easiest thing. It just kind of came naturally. I think at that time West Coast hip hop was huge; all these kids around me were like, 'I want to be a rapper.' But I'm a white girl, not going to be a rapper.
I really love poetry. I'm a big E.E. Cummings fan and a big Walt Whitman fan, and I have a big book of poetry.
My next project is to get back to that. Actually, to learn how to write poetry. I'm not kidding.
Let my life as Poet begin. I want the life of the Poet. I have labored for over twelve years, one thousand pages of prose. Now, I want the easiness of poetry. The brevity of the poem.
Poetry is fascinating. As soon as it begins the poetry has changed the thing into something extra, and somehow prose can go over into poetry.
I am not ridiculing verbal mechanisms, dreams, or repressions as origins of poetry; all three of them and more besides may have a great deal to do with it.
Poetry, especially traditional Iranian poetry, is very good at looking at things from a number of different angles simultaneously.
I don't live for poetry. I live far more than anybody else does.
I think it comes from really liking literary forms. Poetry is very beautiful, but the space on the page can be as affecting as where the text is. Like when Miles Davis doesn't play, it has a poignancy to it.
There is a wonderful Hungarian literature, especially in lyric poetry.
And my father was a comic. He could play any musical instrument. He loved to perform. He was a wonderfully comedic character. He had the ability to dance and sing and charm and analyze poetry.
I started out as a writer. Poetry and prose and also kind of satirical David Sedaris-esque stuff.
One of my greatest joys is poetry. I read it almost every day, and I've even taken a stab at writing some of my own. A poem I wrote for my mother when she was dying really helped me get through that hard time.
I've done a number of readings at poetry lounges in Vancouver and Los Angeles. I've compiled a book of poetry that's completed, and two others I'm working on.
Because people are very interested in my poetry, in what I say.
For me, movies and television are interesting because they are the dominant storytelling form of our time. My first love will always be fiction, and especially novels, but I'm a writer... I write poetry and essays and criticism and I'd love to write a whole play, and sometimes I even write scripts.
I liked painting and drawing, and I liked humanities mainly - poetry, literature - this speculative attitude toward life.
I think poetry is the only domain where a writer you like can truly be said to influence you, because you read and reread a poem so many times that it simply drills itself into your head.
A lot of people think, 'I'll give acting or poetry or filmmaking a try. And if it doesn't work out I'll go get a law degree, do something else that's more practical.' For me I went the reverse way. I lived the back-up plan.
It's necessary to start most work alone. But I'm tickled to death when I can pull somebody in or join someone, whether it's borrowing poetry or traveling with an associate.
I realized poetry's the thing that I can do 'cause I can stick at it and work with tremendous intensity.
The irony is, going to work every day became the subject of probably my best poetry.
My mother carried on and supported us; her ambition had been to write poetry and songs.
In politics, as in poetry, it is sometimes true that it is darkest before dawn.
Otherwise I don't read much adult poetry at all, because I'm not smart enough and mostly I don't get it.
I look for poetry in English because it's the only language I read.
I believe the death of Bobby Kennedy was in many ways the death of decency in America. I think it was the death of manners and formality, the death of poetry and the death of a dream.
The arts generally have had to recognize Modernism - how should poetry escape?
I'm as much influenced by Joseph Smith and the Mormons as I am, more so, than by Eliot. Actually, I'm much more influenced by the poetry of the Mormons.
It is true that short forms of poetry have been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe; but in all European literature short forms of poetry are to be found - indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese.
Music is my thing. It's my thing; it's what I love. It's what I do. It's football to me; it's Christmas to me; religion to me; poetry to me.
A very intimate sense of the expressiveness of outward things, which ponders, listens, penetrates, where the earlier, less developed consciousness passed lightly by, is an important element in the general temper of our modern poetry.
Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.
Poetry is at the centre of my life, too, emotionally speaking, and intellectually speaking - it's just that I'm one of those people who enjoy doing other stuff as well.
I'm not precisely saying that a really good board meeting at the MLA (Museums, Libraries and Archives Coucil) makes me want to go and write poetry, but there is a pleasure in doing that sort of thing well.
I wish I'd been better able to resist the sense of obligation to write some of the poems I did. It's in the nature of commissioned work to be written too much from the side of your mind that knows what it's doing, which dries up the poetry.
Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.
I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.
I don't think rap really fits in to 'American Idol' in the sense that I believe rap is an art form in itself more akin to poetry, more akin to drama, if you will.
I'm not an academic, but I've always loved poetry since I've been small.
Poetry is at least an elegance and at most a revelation.
I was a visual artist primarily and a writer, even from a very young age. I wrote a lot of stories and poetry and... I had a desire to create always. And I always had a desire to show my work.
I think poetry is best read to oneself.
Do-gooders are easily overlooked. We're supposed to be soft, touchy-feely types, who wear Birkenstocks, compost everything, and write poetry by candlelight.
Poetry is the key to the hieroglyphics of nature.
To be born in Wales, not with a silver spoon in your mouth, but, with music in your blood and with poetry in your soul, is a privilege indeed.
Music has a poetry of its own, and that poetry is called melody.
Science and art, or by the same token, poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion. The purpose of the journey is its goal, the purpose of an excursion is the process.
The idea that myth is the opposite of knowledge, or the opposite of truth, is simply to disallow it. It is like saying poetry is the opposite of truth.
I'm a storyteller: the crux of the matter is to reach beauty, poetry; it doesn't matter if that is comedy or tragedy. They're the same if you reach the beauty.
Granted, I'm someone who loves words. I've always loved poetry - so it's suited to me.
I began the way nearly everybody I ever heard of - I began writing poetry. And I find that to be quite usual with writers, their trying their hand at poetry.
I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.
It was actually a women's writing group I belonged to in graduate school that gave me the courage to move from poetry to fiction.
The trouble with us in America isn't that the poetry of life has turned to prose, but that it has turned to advertising copy.
In high school I was very much involved in poetry. You cannot read a poem quickly. There's too much going on there. There are rhythms and alliterations. You have to read poetry slow, slow, slow to absorb it all.
I had art as a major, along with English, French and History. I had dance, modern dance. In English I was allowed to write my own poetry, which I eventually got published.
Poetry brings all possible experience to the same degree: a degree in the consciousness beyond which the consciousness itself cannot go.
I think poetry has lost an awful lot of its muscle because nobody knows any. Nobody has to memorize poetry.
Poetry is composing for the breath.
Poetry was invented as an mnemonic device to enable people to remember their prayers.
Poetry should be able to reach everybody, and it should be able to appeal to all levels of understanding.
But poetry is my life. Poetry is what matters to me.
And there are a lot more people reading poetry, but there are not so many people reading an individual poet.
There are so many things that poetry is about, one of which is memory.
It is a way we reassess our past. We can do that in poetry in ways we can't do in prose.
Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, there is no reason either in football or in poetry why the two should not meet in a man's life if he has the weight and cares about the words.
She was the Judy Garland of American poetry.
Poetry is something that happens in universities, in creative writing programs or in English departments.
I would say that American poetry has always been a poetry of personal testimony.
And at least in poetry you should feel free to lie. That is, not to lie, but to imagine what you want, to follow the direction of the poem.
A life is not sufficiently elevated for poetry, unless, of course, the life has been made into an art.
Poetry is innocent, not wise. It does not learn from experience, because each poetic experience is unique.
Well I guess the plan was to write poetry and publish books and make a living from writing poetry. That was a pretty ambitious plan I guess.
Lyrical poetry is not a big part of most people's lives. Twitter now becomes an interesting way of getting cared for language into people's space. Because there is something deep inside of us that responds to cared for language, whether it's literary, poetry, or really good lyrics in a song.
Poetry is a succession of questions which the poet constantly poses.
I think there's no excuse for the American poetry reader not knowing a good deal about what is going on in the rest of the world.
You watch an old 'Jeopardy!' and the categories alone are very plain. 'Poetry,' or 'Movies,' or 'Physics.' If you watch it now, though, there'll be a theme board where the categories are all Hitchcock movies. Lots more jokes, lots more high-concept categories and questions.
Poetry teaches us music, metaphor, condensation and specificity.
And yet, in a culture like ours, which is given to material comforts, and addicted to forms of entertainment that offer immediate gratification, it is surprising that so much poetry is written.
There's one of my new poems actually - is a good example of where my poetry has ended up. My earlier river poetry was more like a cross between Shelley and Dylan Thomas.
What we know is that Shakespeare wrote perhaps the most remarkable body of passionate love poetry in the English language to a young man.
But in the finished art of the song the use of words has no connection with the use of words in poetry.
If it is an imperfect word, no external circumstance can heighten its value as poetry.
It should here be added that poetry habitually takes the form of verse.
Poetry is the communication through words of certain experiences that can be communicated in no other way.
One can't write for all readers. A poet cannot write for people who don't like poetry.
Poetry does not consist of words alone; there must be sentiment and fancy, combination and arrangement.
Poetry is the impish attempt to paint the color of the wind.
Whereas with poetry no one has to show anybody really, and you don't have to tell anyone you're doing it.
I love to write poetry.
I guess I find the boundaries between poetry and prose to be somewhat permeable.
Poetry and prose are of equal importance to me as a reader, and there doesn't seem to be much difference in my own writing.
While I've had a great distaste for what's usually called song in modern poetry or for what's usually called music, I really don't think of speech as so far from song.
I can recite poetry, but I cannot write it.
Lapped in poetry, wrapped in the picturesque, armed with logical sentences and inalienable words.
Because, in fact, women, feminists, do read my poetry, and they read it often with the power of their political interpretation. I don't care; that's what poetry is supposed to do.
I'm perfectly happy when I look out at an audience and it's all women. I always think it's kind of odd, but then, more women than men, I think, read and write poetry.
PC stuff just lowers the general acceptance of good work and replaces it with bogus poetry that celebrates values that in themselves are probably quite worthy.
From reading a previous answer, you know that I consider all those aspects to be part of American cultural myth and thus they figure into good American poetry, whether the poet is aware of what he is doing or not.
I don't like political poetry, and I don't write it. If this question was pointing towards that, I think it is missing the point of the American tradition, which is always apolitical, even when the poetry comes out of politically active writers.
I have always wanted what I have now come to call the voice of personal narrative. That has always been the appealing voice in poetry. It started for me lyrically in Shakespeare's sonnets.
I have not the slightest pretension to call my verses poetry; I write now and then for no other purpose than to relieve depression or to improve my English.
And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry, they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art! But, after a decade of hand-wringing and apologies, I can't quite muster the guilt anymore.
When you translate poetry in particular, you're obliged to look at how the writer with whom you're working puts together words, sentences, phrases, the triple tension between the line of verse, the syntax and the sentence.
Poetry seems to have been eliminated as a literary genre, and installed instead, as a kind of spiritual aerobic exercise - nobody need read it, but anybody can do it.
Stadium rock and commercial rock are the opposite of what poetry needs. An audience of around 200 is ideal for poetry.
I use rock and jazz and blues rhythms because I love that music. I hope my poetry has a relationship with good-time rock'n roll.
I guess the two Manifesto, Communicating Vessels, Mad Love, and some of his poetry made a significant mark on me but as far as bringing a literary element into the music I see it as a much broader assimilation.
Now, to read poetry at all is to have an ideal anthology of one's own, and in that possession to be incapable of content with the anthologies of all the world besides.
I always liked the magic of poetry but now I'm just starting to see behind the curtain of even the best poets, how they've used, tried and tested craft to create the illusion. Wonderful feeling of exhilaration to finally be there.
On the other hand, if there's an underlying core of poetry that I go to, I go to the sea. I've lived on the sea all my life. I live on the sea in Cape Breton.
I love painting and music, of course. I don't know nearly as much about them as I know about poetry. I've certainly been influenced by fiction. I was overwhelmed by War and Peace when I read it, and I didn't read it until I was in my late 20s.
I was excited by what my painter friends were doing, and they seemed to be interested in our poetry too, and that was a wonderful little, fizzy sort of world.
I wonder if I ever thought of an ideal reader... I guess when I was in my 20s and in New York and maybe even in my early 30s, I would write for my wife Janice... mainly for my poet friends and my wife, who was very smart about poetry.
I was influenced by surrealist poetry and painting as were thousands of other people, and it seems to me to have become a part of the way I write, but it's not.
Even the people who have had success and made money writing these books of fiction seem to feel the need to pretend it's no big deal, or part of a natural progression from poetry to fiction, but often it's really just about the money, the perceived prestige.
Serious poetry deals with the fundamental conflicts that cannot be logically resolved: we can state the conflicts rationally, but reason does not relieve us of them.
Poetry comes alive to me through recitation.
There's not a good poet I know who has not at the beck and call of his memory a vast quantity of poetry that composes his mental library.
I believe that the short story is as different a form from the novel as poetry is, and the best stories seem to me to be perhaps closer in spirit to poetry than to novels.
I published, privately, a collection of my serious poetry I had written over the years. I only published 50 copies, which I gave to friends, in a special deluxe edition. It was ridiculously expensive but I'm glad that I did it.
I want to write a book of poetry, as well as children's stories.
The urge to write poetry is like having an itch. When the itch becomes annoying enough, you scratch it.
I think what will happen is that fiction will become more like poetry. As in, the only people who read it will write it.
Poetry, for me, is the answer to, 'How does one stay sane when private lives are being ransacked by public events?' It's something that hangs over your head all the time.
Theater and poetry were what helped people stay alive and want to go on living.
I don't think Auden liked my poetry very much, he's very Anglican.
My cure for writer's block is to step away from the thing I'm stuck on, usually a novel, and write something totally different. Besides fiction, I write poetry, screenplays, essays and journalism. It's usually not the writing itself that I'm stuck on, but thing I'm trying to write. So I often have four or five things going at once.
Well, the great thing for me about poetry is that in good poems the dislocation of words, that is to say, the distance between what they say they're saying and what they are actually saying is at its greatest.
Well, I had this little notion - I started writing when I was eleven, writing poetry. I was passionately addicted to it; it was my great refuge through adolescence.
In a way I spend my entire life stealing from everything - from the past, from cities I love, from where I grew up - grabbing things, taking not only from architecture but from Italy, art, writing, poetry, music.
I think many people love poetry who don't know they love it. People are sometimes afraid of poetry, or they've been introduced to poetry that doesn't speak to them.
How much money you get, depends on lots of extraneous things. It depends on how good you are at turning poetry into a marketable product, which is something it was never supposed to be. That's why many people suppose that the better the poet you are the lower your income should be, and that's probably true.
Probably induced by the asthma, I started reading and writing early on, my literary efforts from the age of about nine running chiefly to poetry and plays.
My obsession with time informs my poetry so completely it is hard for me to summarize it. We want time to pass, for new things to happen to us, we want to hold on to certain moments, we don't want our lives to end.
There are interesting forms of difficulty, and there are unprofitable forms of difficulty. I mean, I enjoy some difficult poetry, but some of it is impenetrable and I actually wouldn't want to penetrate it if I could, perhaps.
Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem.
Well, if this is poetry, I'm certainly never going to write any myself.
Meet some people who care about poetry the way you do. You'll have that readership. Keep going until you know you're doing work that's worthy. And then see what happens. That's my advice.
Now I think poetry will save nothing from oblivion, but I keep writing about the ordinary because for me it's the home of the extraordinary, the only home.
Poetry seems to sink into us the way prose doesn't. I can still quote verses I learned when I was very young, but I have trouble remembering one line of a novel I just finished reading.
My wife has been my greatest earthly inspiration. She excels in eloquence, the poetry of words, empathy and graciousness.
Even if you only want to write science fiction, you should also read mysteries, poetry, mainstream literature, history, biography, philosophy, and science.

Knowledge without justice ought to be called cunning rather than wisdom.
The learning and knowledge that we have, is, at the most, but little compared with that of which we are ignorant.
Entire ignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil, and is far from being the greatest of all; too much cleverness and too much learning, accompanied with ill bringing-up, are far more fatal.
To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.
Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.

Humility and knowledge in poor clothes excel pride and ignorance in costly attire.
All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions.

Knowledge which is divorced from justice, may be called cunning rather than wisdom.
I had therefore to remove knowledge, in order to make room for belief.
If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a mere transmission of knowledge, there is little to be hoped from it in the bettering of man's future. For what is the use of transmitting knowledge if the individual's total development lags behind?
Property may be destroyed and money may lose its purchasing power; but, character, health, knowledge and good judgement will always be in demand under all conditions.

Without knowledge action is useless and knowledge without action is futile.
I'm hungry for knowledge. The whole thing is to learn every day, to get brighter and brighter. That's what this world is about. You look at someone like Gandhi, and he glowed. Martin Luther King glowed. Muhammad Ali glows. I think that's from being bright all the time, and trying to be brighter.
Knowledge is like money: to be of value it must circulate, and in circulating it can increase in quantity and, hopefully, in value.

I'm a strict, strict agnostic. It's very different from a casual, 'I don't know.' It's that you cannot present as knowledge something that is not knowledge. You can present it as faith, you can present it as belief, but you can't present it as fact.

Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn't exist yet, but soon will, and will change everything for everybody, and nothing will ever be the same again.

For thousands of years, human beings have been obsessed with beauty, truth, love, honor, altruism, courage, social relationships, art, and God. They all go together as subjective experiences, and it's a straw man to set God up as the delusion. If he is, then so is truth itself or beauty itself.
People who don't like me talk about it as though I'm trash because I have tattoos. I find that insane because it's 2008, not the 1950s. Tattoos aren't limited to sailors. It's a form of art I find beautiful. I love it.

Speaking for myself, art differs from writing in that I never know what I'm going to paint until I paint it, so it's almost like automatic writing. A writer, on the other hand, can't help but know what he's going to write, because the activity demands a degree of premeditation.
Great artists are people who find the way to be themselves in their art. Any sort of pretension induces mediocrity in art and life alike.
What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.
A lot of country music is sad. I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times. It applies to music. Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is. There is a lot of heartache in the world.
Simplicity is natures first step, and the last of art.
Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.
What an artist is trying to do for people is bring them closer to something, because of course art is about sharing. You wouldn't be an artist unless you wanted to share an experience, a thought.
It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.
When the bright angel dominates, out comes a great work of art, a Michelangelo David or a Beethoven symphony.
Skill without imagination is craftsmanship and gives us many useful objects such as wickerwork picnic baskets. Imagination without skill gives us modern art.

Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.
Sculpture is the art of the hole and the lump.
Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art.
I did study the art of being a barber because I wanted to figure out what my routine would be. Do you start in the front or back? Top or bottom? Swivel the chair or walk around? What I did discover is there's no such thing as the perfect haircut!
Art is a mind-game that we do to make our lives easier. If it isn't for that, it becomes superfluous.
Dance is the only art of which we ourselves are the stuff of which it is made.
You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there, if it's received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it's not received, great, I respect you for not.
Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.
Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber's wax dummy is to sculpture.
Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.
The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.
I love rock-n-roll. I think it's an exciting art form. It's revolutionary. Still revolutionary and it changed people. It changed their hearts. But yeah, even rock-n-roll has a lot of rubbish, really bad music.
All the world old is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer.
Sound as medium has an incredible elasticity. So, of course, it is tempting for artists of other fields to try something with sounds. Why not? We are living in the age when there is no limit in gathering all forms of art and music to mix it together if you so desire.
A good mother remembers to serve fruit at breakfast, is always cheerful and never yells, manages not to project her own neuroses and inadequacies onto her children, is an active and beloved community volunteer. She remembers to make play dates, her children's clothes fit, she does art projects with them and enjoys all their games.
Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you don't want it.
The art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness, but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change; happiness, like a child, must be allowed to grow up.
I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.
I think that one's art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows.
At the University of Maryland, my first year I started off planning to major in art because I was interested in theatre design, stage design or television design.
I've been lucky enough to live through all the things that are supposed to give meaning to our lives, like parenting, grandparenting, art, celebrity. All these things you expect meaning to come from, and sometimes it comes when you're not expecting it.
We can learn the art of fierce compassion - redefining strength, deconstructing isolation and renewing a sense of community, practicing letting go of rigid us-vs.-them thinking - while cultivating power and clarity in response to difficult situations.
Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.
My favorite books, art pieces, films, and music, always have something jarring about them.
The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.
Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.

Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.
Madonna remains the most visible performer on the planet, as well as one of the wealthiest, but would anyone seriously say that artistic self-development is her primary motivating principle? She is too busy with Kabbalah, fashion merchandising, adoption melodramas, the gym, and ill-starred horseback riding to study art.
Evanescence fans aren't the popular kids in school. They aren't the cheerleaders. It's the art kids and the nerds and the kids who grow up to be the most interesting creative people.
All equestrians, if they last long enough, learn that riding in whatever form is a lifelong sport and art, an endeavor that is both familiar and new every time you take the horse out of his stall or pasture.
Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.
The Dancer believes that his art has something to say which cannot be expressed in words or in any other way than by dancing.
It may be that the deep necessity of art is the examination of self-deception.
I don't know if One Direction will stand the test of time. I have a niece who goes crazy for them. But the only way to judge art is to wait and see if it becomes evergreen. This takes a bit of time. Adele is a very good musician and I'd like to sing with her. But, again, time will tell if her music will become evergreen.
Celebrity doesn't have anything to do with art or craft. It's about being rich and thinking that you're better than everybody else.

Use the creative process - singing, writing, art, dance, whatever - to get to know yourself better.
I never, ever had it in my mind that I wanted to be in the record industry, because I still contend that the record industry is an insidious affair. It's this terrible collision between art and commerce, and it will always be that way.
Art is elemental. Reason alone as it's expressed in the sciences can't be man's complete answer to reality, and it can't express everything that man can, wants to, and has to express. I think God built this into man. Art along with science is the highest gift God has given him.
I think all art is about control - the encounter between control and the uncontrollable.
A good face they say, is a letter of recommendation. O Nature, Nature, why art thou so dishonest, as ever to send men with these false recommendations into the World!
There is only one valuable thing in art: the thing you cannot explain.
I'm not really sure what social message my art carries, if any. And I don't really want it to carry one. I'm not interested in the subject matter to try to teach society anything, or to try to better our world in any way.
Only in art will the lion lie down with the lamb, and the rose grow without thorn.
Advertising is the art of the tiny. You have to tell a complete a story and deliver a complete message in a very encapsulated form. It disciplines you to cut away extraneous information.
Surprise is key in all art.
All I tell artists is, 'Do what you love. Never let anybody talk you into changing what your musical idea is just to try to get a hit, because you're chasing your tail that way. It's not going to happen, and if you're successful, you have to do it the rest of your life. Stay true to it and do it for the sake of the art.'
There hasn't been anything real since grunge. That was the last movement led by music or an art form.
If my art has nothing to do with people's pain and sorrow, what is 'art' for?
My focus is my art, and that's what I love to do. I have to be really passionate in order to do something. I've turned down many things that I just didn't believe in.
Art is nothing but the expression of our dream; the more we surrender to it the closer we get to the inner truth of things, our dream-life, the true life that scorns questions and does not see them.

Should graffiti be judged on the same level as modern art? Of course not: It's way more important than that.
By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art.

My body is my art, and it's also the tool that I use to make money.
Our humor turns our anger into a fine art.
If commercialization is putting my art on a shirt so that a kid who can't afford a $30,000 painting can buy one, then I'm all for it.
Art is for everybody.
You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms.
Why must art be static? You look at an abstraction, sculptured or painted, an entirely exciting arrangement of planes, spheres, nuclei, entirely without meaning. It would be perfect, but it is always still. The next step in sculpture is motion.
The house has to please everyone, contrary to the work of art which does not. The work is a private matter for the artist. The house is not.
Nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century exponents of prefabrication were certain it would supplant age-old traditions of individualized design and handcrafted construction. The building art would be revolutionized by freeing designers and construction workers from repetitive tasks, and democratized by making high-style architecture more affordable.
To create a work of art is to create the world.
The beautiful is in nature, and it is encountered under the most diverse forms of reality. Once it is found it belongs to art, or rather to the artist who discovers it.
Anybody can direct a picture once they know the fundamentals. Directing is not a mystery, it's not an art. The main thing about directing is: photograph the people's eyes.
Through art and science in their broadest senses it is possible to make a permanent contribution towards the improvement and enrichment of human life and it is these pursuits that we students are engaged in.
The roles of art, morality, religion, political faith, science itself are not to repair organic exhaustion nor to provide sound functioning of the organs. All this supraphysical life is built and expanded not because of the demands of the cosmic environment but because of the demands of the social environment.
I do not deny that I have made drawings and watercolors of an erotic nature. But they are always works of art. Are there no artists who have done erotic pictures?
What I try to do is the art of building, and the art of building is the art of construction; it is not only about forms and shapes and images.
Once you learn to look at architecture not merely as an art more or less well or more or less badly done, but as a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant.

I went into the business for the money, and the art grew out of it. If people are disillusioned by that remark, I can't help it. It's the truth.
I am a soul. I know well that what I shall render up to the grave is not myself. That which is myself will go elsewhere. Earth, thou art not my abyss!

The art of using deceit and cunning grow continually weaker and less effective to the user.
A work of art that contains theories is like an object on which the price tag has been left.

We live in an age when the traditional great subjects - the human form, the landscape, even newer traditions such as abstract expressionism - are daily devalued by commercial art.
I'm for mechanical art. When I took up silk screening, it was to more fully exploit the preconceived image through the commercial techniques of multiple reproduction.
All good art is an indiscretion.
To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living.
Art is the objectification of feeling.
You want to be a bit compulsive in your art or craft or whatever you do. You want to be focused on it.
Art is anything you can get away with.
It is not hard to understand modern art. If it hangs on a wall it's a painting, and if you can walk around it it's a sculpture.
I wasn't exposed to art as I was growing up, and can't recall the first time I saw a work of art. However, I remember very clearly a vision I had of a little green reindeer when I was a child, and visions emanate from the same mythical area where painting resides. Whatever the reason, I immediately felt comfortable working with visual materials.
An art which isn't based on feeling isn't an art at all.
Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.
Don't be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation.
Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art.
What I've discovered is that in art, as in music, there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth, but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for, my moment. It's the moment that the audience falls in love.
When science, art, literature, and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible, which can make a man's name live for thousands of years.
I don't think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today. But it's certainly worth a try.

The art is long, life is short.
He has only half learned the art of reading who has not added to it the more refined art of skipping and skimming.
I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist.
The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.
In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character; there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.
Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience.
It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.

I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.'
Politics is the art of the possible.
I'm into sincerity in music and sincerity in art. If it doesn't feel true, I don't want to do it. Things that are too dramatic scare me. I think that's why I don't always fit into the world of performing arts.
I am a real person that cares about his art and cares about what he's doing - I have a heart and a soul and want to touch people and give.
Nothing right can be accomplished in art without enthusiasm.
Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.

Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.

Courage is the art of being the only one who knows you're scared to death.
In science, if you don't do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn't compose the 'Ninth Symphony,' no one else before or after is going to compose the 'Ninth Symphony' that he composed; no one else is going to paint 'Starry Night' by van Gogh.
There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause.

Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.
Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.
I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.
The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order.
In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don't know what we're seeing, we overreact.

Whether it be personal or musical, I just think I'm a walking art piece, just a ball of creativity.

The painter who feels obligated to depict his subjects as uniformly beautiful or handsome and without flaws will fall short of making art.
Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.

A painter's tastes must grow out of what so obsesses him in life that he never has to ask himself what it is suitable for him to do in art.
The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion.
Art has a double visage: it looks before and after. Romance is its forward-looking face. The germ of growth is in romanticism. Formalism, on the other hand, consolidates tradition; gleans what has been gained and makes it facile to the hand or the mind; economizes the energy of genius.
If you don't get noticed, you don't have anything. You just have to be noticed, but the art is in getting noticed naturally, without screaming or without tricks.
Hip-hop don't have no fresh energy, none at all. It's money driven, everybody tryin' to make that cheque, nobody putting art in their albums any more.

I don't want to sound pretentious, but I love art, I like to go to museums, and I like to read books.

Magic's an art where you use slight of hand or illusion to create wonder. And I was just intrigued with that idea.
It's great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.
You've got to invest in the world, you've got to read, you've got to go to art galleries, you've got to find out the names of plants. You've got to start to love the world and know about the whole genius of the human race. We're amazing people.
Cats are anthropomorphised in art because they are so laid back that you automatically attribute human thoughts and feelings to them.
The growth of art seems to be in cycles, and often its vigorous lifetime is restricted to a century or two. The periods of distinctive drama, Greek, English, Spanish, fall within such a limit; the schools of painting and sculpture likewise; and, in poetry, the Victorian age or the school of Pope will serve as examples.
All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.
Most painting in the European tradition was painting the mask. Modern art rejected all that. Our subject matter was the person behind the mask.

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.

All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.
We foresee no limit to scientific advancement in the future, and in scientific truth there is nothing dead; science is always a living and growing body of knowledge; but art on the contrary has many times run its course to an end, and exhausted its vital power.
It is unhappily true that much insincere Literature and Art, executed solely with a view to effect, does succeed by deceiving the public.

I adore art... when I am alone with my notes, my heart pounds and the tears stream from my eyes, and my emotion and my joys are too much to bear.

I've studied astrology for many, many years, and I feel like it's an incredibly challenging art.
In order to figure this artmaking stuff out, it's trial and error and experimentation, and takes some time and hard thinking.

Lebanon was at one time known as a nation that rose above sectarian hatred; Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East.

It's a theory.

I don't really care what people tell children - when you believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, one more fib won't hurt. But I am infuriated by the growing notion, posited in some touchy-feely quarters, that all women are, or can be, beautiful.

Barbie ruined my life! It's a really bad image for women. For a long time I thought I was deformed - because my heels didn't touch the ground. I was walking around on tiptoes. What's up with that? I think that it's a bad thing for a woman to try to emulate.

Men, women, and children who cannot live on gravity alone need something to satisfy their gayer, lighter moods and hours, and he who ministers to this want is, in my opinion, in a business established by the Creator of our nature. If he worthily fulfills his mission and amuses without corrupting, he need never feel that he has lived in vain.
This world crisis came about without women having anything to do with it. If the women of the world had not been excluded from world affairs, things today might have been different.
Yes, women are stronger than us. They face more directly the problems that confront them, and for that reason they are much more spectacular to talk about. I don't know why I am more interested in women, because I don't go to any psychiatrists, and I don't want to know why.
We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty million women are denied the right to vote.

Men aren't the way they are because they want to drive women crazy; they've been trained to be that way for thousands of years. And that training makes it very difficult for men to be intimate.
Women are the real reason we get up every day. I'm talking about real men. If there were no women, I would not even have to bathe, because why would I care? These are guys I'm hanging with. I wake up for a woman every day of my life to make it happen for her.
What is sad for women of my generation is that they weren't supposed to work if they had families. What were they going to do when the children are grown - watch the raindrops coming down the window pane?

We say 'I'm not doing anything.' She starts crying.

I'm a simple man. All I want is enough sleep for two normal men, enough whiskey for three, and enough women for four.
Feminism is liberalism, and look at what it's doing, look at what it's promoting, look at what it's condoning. All the while, we have to live in this lie that there's some sort of Republican War on Women. We don't do this to women! We don't objectify women like this.
All societies on the verge of death are masculine. A society can survive with only one man; no society will survive a shortage of women.

I think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking. Men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends. That's a gross generalization, but I think it holds in many ways.

There might be a lot of difference between Republicans and Democrats on key social issues like women's rights and health care. But when it comes to taking corporate cash, they're pretty much the same beast.
Breast cancer is being detected at an earlier, more treatable stage these days, largely because women are taking more preventive measures, like self-exams and regular mammograms. And treatment is getting better too.
I'm interested in what happens to people when they get into that publicity machine. We tend to think things have changed, but there's still a deep sexism underlying the way women are treated publicly.
I think feminism means what it has always meant - women want to use all their gifts, all their talents and be judged impartially for them. I don't think feminism has ever meant anything else.
Women always try to see the one good part of The Weird Guy because the dating landscape is so bleak. Women will say, 'He's very odd, but he likes to cook. He's creepy, but he makes good pancakes!'
I can hear the roar of women's silence.
Here's the thing, men have to also mature in how they see women, too. Because they need to understand that it's not just about how we look, it's about who we are. And I am going to tell you like this, 'If you can't love me with short hair, and you telling me I got to have long hair to be loved, guess what, I ain't the one for you.'
I make a point to never, ever point out my physical flaws... this is advice I give to women as often as I can. People don't notice the things we see in ourselves that we hate, so why direct them to it?
A sexual revolution begins with the emancipation of women, who are the chief victims of patriarchy, and also with the ending of homosexual oppression.
Many differences are rooted in biology and reinforced through culture, so it's important to acknowledge that. Because if you say men and women are the same and if male behaviour is the norm, and women are always expected to act like men, we will never be as good at being men as men are.
Men's memoirs are about answers; women's memoirs are about questions. Most male authors want to look good in their memoirs and have a place in posterity, while most women know that posterity is what happens when you no longer care. Women want to connect with others here and now; they couldn't care less about legacy!
What is feminism? Simply the belief that women should be as free as men, however nuts, dim, deluded, badly dressed, fat, receding, lazy, and smug they might be.
What some men don't understand is that by opposing policies to reduce violence, promote equal pay and universal healthcare and voting to limit access to contraception and legal abortion, they are relegating women to another century, a time when men ruled exclusively and women were considered property and had to be guided by a firm masculine hand.
When women reassert their relationship with the wildish nature, they are gifted with a permanent and internal watcher, a knower, a visionary, an oracle, an inspiratrice, an intuitive, a maker, a creator, an inventor, and a listener who guide, suggest, and urge vibrant life in the inner and outer world.
If there's specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can't change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies.
Women are better at reading body language everywhere in the world. As a matter of fact, it's associated with the female hormone estrogen. Women are better at figuring out of tone of voice, reading your face and posture and gesture.
I'm not telling women to be like men. I'm telling us to evaluate what men and women do in the workforce and at home without the gender bias.
Young women from a very young age are taught that life will be easier if you can just turn on the charming smile and say very little and be complacent and docile and sweet.
There's something incredibly sexy about sand and sweat and dunes photographed like women's backs.
We live in a quick-fix society where we need instant gratification for everything. Too fat? Get lipo-sucked. Stringy hair? Glue on extensions. Wrinkles and lines? Head to the beauty shop for a pot of the latest miracle skin stuff. It's all a beautiful &pound;1 billion con foisted upon insecure women by canny cosmetic conglomerates.
I never expected to get the Tom Jones treatment and it amazes me that I do. Strangely it's women who throw their underwear at me when I'm performing live. My male fans tend to be quite shy. My female fans are wild. I never know what to do with all the lingerie that lands at my feet. Maybe I should open a shop.
There's something brave and touching about game girls of all ages keeping themselves smart in hard times - one thinks of those wonderful women during World War II drawing stocking seams in eyebrow pencil up the back of legs stained with gravy browning because nylons were so hard to get hold of.
I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.
You, too, women, cast away all the cowards from your embraces; they will give you only cowards for children, and you who are the daughters of the land of beauty must bear children who are noble and brave.
Women always want to be what they're not: If you're the pretty girl, you want to be the quirky girl. If you're the smart girl, you want to be the pretty girl.
Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.
I grew up in a house full of women: my mother, grandmother, three sisters, and two female cats. And I still have the buzz of their conversations in my head. As an adult, I have more female friends than male ones: I just love the way that women talk.
As a woman leader, I thought I brought a different kind of leadership. I was interested in women's issues, in bringing down the population growth rate... as a woman, I entered politics with an additional dimension - that of a mother.
There's just something about vampires that's sexy. It's the same reason why women go for the bad boy - you want them but you shouldn't have them.
Reproductive choice has to be straightened out. There will never be a woman of means without choice anymore. That just seems to me so obvious. The states that changed their abortion laws before Roe are not going to change back. So we have a policy that only affects poor women, and it can never be otherwise.
Until women learn to want economic independence, and until they work out a way to get this independence without denying themselves the joys of love and motherhood, it seems to me feminism has no roots.
I often think a lot of women's attraction to vampires is based on the fact that vampires come from centuries ago, from eras of chivalry and courtly virtues.
And the first commandment of feminism is: I am woman; thou shalt not tolerate strange gods who assert that women have capabilities or often choose roles that are different from men's.
It's now taken for granted that women are in bands and you can say feminist things in your songs. But back in the early '90s, there was a lot of violence at Bikini Kill shows that people don't realize happened.
The failure of women to have reached positions of leadership has been due in large part to social and professional discrimination.
Women work harder. And women are more honest; they have less reasons to be corrupt.
My mother was a dominant force in our family. And I always saw her as the leader. And that was great for me as a young woman, because I never saw that women had to be dominated by men.
The one thing I have never been afraid of is standing before important people and speaking my mind. I represent women who may never have the opportunity to go to the UN or meet with a president. I'm never afraid to speak truth to power.
The idea that women are innately gentle is a fantasy, and a historically recent one. Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, is depicted as wreathed in male human skulls; the cruel entertainments of the Romans drew audiences as female as they were male; Boudicca led her British troops bloodily into battle.
Women have talent and intelligence but, due to social constraints and prejudices, it is still a long distance away from the goal of gender equality.
There are always women who will take men on their own terms. If I were a man I wouldn't bother to change while there are women like that around.
Suffrage is a common right of citizenship. Women have the right of suffrage. Logically it cannot be escaped.
At the end of the day, both men and women who become CEOs have showed tenacity and hard work to succeed in their careers. It takes not just skills but also extreme dedication and commitment. And regardless of gender, CEOs are measured by the same criteria - the growth and success of the business.
Looking towards the future, one of the most important issues the national community must face is the widening gap between the liberated, modern, independent women and our traditional men who are being left behind.
We need to see men and women as equal partners, but it's hard to think of movies that do that. When I talk to people, they think of movies of forty-five years ago! Hepburn and Tracy!
As a vibrant force in civil society, women continue to press for their rights, equal participation in decision-making, and the upholding of the principles of the revolution by the highest levels of leadership in Egypt.
It should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in behalf of women. As men become aware that few have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance.
Calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem. It gives a lot of men an excuse not to pay attention.
Well, the tyranny of masculinity and the tyranny of patriarchy I think has been much more deadly to men than it has to women. It hasn't killed our hearts. It's killed men's hearts. It's silenced them; it's cut them off.
The first organised opposition by women to women's suffrage in England dates from 1889, when a number of ladies led by Mrs Ward appealed against the proposed extension of the Parliamentary suffrage to women.
I was at a meeting two years ago in Beijing, and I passed a bunch of women who were marching in a protest. Their signs were probably saying something I wouldn't have agreed with at all. But I was so glad to see women marching. And it's happening all over the world.
It is essential that the women's preventive coverage benefit, including contraception, be available to all women, regardless of what health plan they have or where they work - as Congress intended. Providing access to birth control just makes good sense.
We Abolition Women are turning the world upside down.
Hence, within the space of two generations there has been a complete revolution in the attitude of the trades-unions toward the women working in their trades.
The fickleness of the women I love is only equalled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me.
A man can be short and dumpy and getting bald but if he has fire, women will like him.
Nothing can be more absurd than the practice that prevails in our country of men and women not following the same pursuits with all their strengths and with one mind, for thus, the state instead of being whole is reduced to half.
Once you get a spice in your home, you have it forever. Women never throw out spices. The Egyptians were buried with their spices. I know which one I'm taking with me when I go.
I try to speak my points of view about black America, and how I feel about black men and the role that black men should play in their lives with their children and in their lives with their women.
As I've said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it. And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for Iraqis' future.
Money and women are the most sought after and the least known about of any two things we have.
Why are women... so much more interesting to men than men are to women?
A man's brain has a more difficult time shifting from thinking to feeling than a women's brain does.
Love is an emotion that is based on an opinion of women that is impossible for those who have had any experience with them.

Men are just as sensitive, and in some ways more sensitive, than women are.
Women are tenacious, and all of them should be tenacious of respect; without esteem they cannot exist; esteem is the first demand that they make of love.
Most women are one man away from welfare.
San Francisco is a mad city - inhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people whose women are of a remarkable beauty.
To be completely woman you need a master, and in him a compass for your life. You need a man you can look up to and respect. If you dethrone him it's no wonder that you are discontented, and discontented women are not loved for long.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love.
I fought all my life for women to make their own choices, in their personal and professional lives. I made mine.
I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.
The simplest of women are wonderful liars who can extricate themselves from the most difficult dilemmas with a skill bordering on genius.
Women - always in trouble with them, but can't live without them.
The history of men's opposition to women's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.
I have never met anyone who did not support our troops. Sometimes, however, we hear accusations that someone or some group does not support the men and women serving in our Armed Forces. But this is pure demagoguery, and it is intellectually dishonest.
Most women's magazines simply try to mold women into bigger and better consumers.
I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is. It's been the same thing for a while. It's hard for female comedians to stand out. That's weird. That's a shame.
Men at most differ as Heaven and Earth, but women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.
We must make it clear that a platform of 'I hate gay men and women' is not a way to become president of the United States.
The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women.
Clearly older women and especially older women who have led an active life or elder women who successfully maneuver through their own family life have so much to teach us about sharing, patience, and wisdom.
In Hollywood, the women are all peaches. It makes one long for an apple occasionally.
I've looked on many women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times. God knows I will do this and forgives me.
Grace in women has more effect than beauty.
A revival does two things. First, it returns the Church from her backsliding and second, it causes the conversion of men and women; and it always includes the conviction of sin on the part of the Church. What a spell the devil seems to cast over the Church today!
While gossip among women is universally ridiculed as low and trivial, gossip among men, especially if it is about women, is called theory, or idea, or fact.
Men who consistently leave the toilet seat up secretly want women to get up to go the bathroom in the middle of the night and fall in.
When I get up and work out, I'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me, because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly, who invests in them, but who also invests in herself. It's just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list.
I had used eclectic therapy and behavior therapy on myself at the age of 19 to get over my fear of public speaking and of approaching young women in public.
Women encourage men to be childish, then scold them.
Women who love women are Lesbians. Men, because they can only think of women in sexual terms, define Lesbian as sex between women.
I find very often that very ugly women have really handsome men and vice versa because they don't have any competition. Sometimes handsome men have avoided me.
Men and women have strengths that complement each other.
Women's fashion is a subtle form of bondage. It's men's way of binding them. We put them in these tight, high-heeled shoes, we make them wear these tight clothes and we say they look sexy. But they're actually tied up.
No woman has to be a victim of physical abuse. Women have to feel like they are not alone.
Obamacare is making people divorce so they can afford it. And divorce hurts women and the children, and that is Obamacare and their War on Women.
Men should only believe half of what women say. But which half?
I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines. I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that.
Reading, solitude, idleness, a soft and sedentary life, intercourse with women and young people, these are perilous paths for a young man, and these lead him constantly into danger.
America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women and children.
Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life. It is also a direct or indirect attack on the male right of access to women.
I hope that women everywhere will wear this jewelry and feel the passion and love that is, to me, the real spirit of True Harmony.
If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president.
When women hold off from marrying men, we call it independence. When men hold off from marrying women, we call it fear of commitment.
Unless we include a job as part of every citizen's right to autonomy and personal fulfillment, women will continue to be vulnerable to someone else's idea of what need is.
Well I do think, when there are more women, that the tone of the conversation changes, and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that, you've forgotten high school.
In mid-life the man wants to see how irresistible he still is to younger women. How they turn their hearts to stone and more or less commit a murder of their marriage I just don't know, but they do.
Men who want to support women in our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to cry; it is important to us that they stop the crimes of violence against us.
People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays; men have to work and women to marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust world.
I love surprises - champagne and strawberries, all that pampering, romantic stuff. Guys ought to know how to pamper their women properly.
I want to say a little something that's long overdue, the disrespect to women has got to be through. To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends, I wanna offer my love and respect till the end.
Advertising is a business of words, but advertising agencies are infested with men and women who cannot write. They cannot write advertisements, and they cannot write plans. They are helpless as deaf mutes on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera.
Beauty is the first present nature gives to women and the first it takes away.
There are some people who still feel threatened by strong women. That's their problem. It's not mine.
I like women. I don't understand them, but I like them.
Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Women's magazines also often feature pictures of naked ladies. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is hairy and lumpy and should not be seen by the light of day.
Women have always been courageous... They are always fearless when protecting their children and in the last century they have been fearless in the fight for their rights.
As they say around the Texas Legislature, if you can't drink their whiskey, screw their women, take their money, and vote against 'em anyway, you don't belong in office.
I wouldn't want my daughters to date a guy like me. I was dangerous around women in my twenties. I'm terrified that they might end up with someone like me.
I definitely think some of my older female peer group are deeply beautiful women. They have this thing that radiates from them.
Black women have always been these vixens, these animalistic erotic women. Why can't we just be the sexy American girl next door?
With women, I've got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end. I slip the loop around their necks so they can't get away or come too close. Like catching snakes.
Giving women education, work, the ability to control their own income, inherit and own property, benefits the society. If a woman is empowered, her children and her family will be better off. If families prosper, the village prospers, and eventually so does the whole country.
I am a writer who happens to love women. I am not a lesbian who happens to write.
It is capitalist America that produced the modern independent woman. Never in history have women had more freedom of choice in regard to dress, behavior, career, and sexual orientation.
I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with, all these fabulous women, 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.' I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple.
I like to help women help themselves, as that is, in my opinion, the best way to settle the woman question. Whatever we can do and do well we have a right to, and I don't think any one will deny us.
Feminism's agenda is basic: It asks that women not be forced to choose between public justice and private happiness.
Women of all classes are awakening to the necessity of self-support, but few are willing to do the ordinary useful work for which they are fitted.
There was a series called 'Game of Thrones' which was very popular here in the United States, a post-Tolkien kind of thing. It was garbage, yet very addictive garbage - because there's lots of violence, all the women take their clothes off all the time, and it's kind of fun.
I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women, because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God's eyes between men and women, slaves and masters, Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God.
Women love working together. That's my experience anyway.
Even back then, I exuded self-confidence, and that drives women crazy.
I didn't fight to get women out from behind vacuum cleaners to get them onto the board of Hoover.
I noticed in the past, a lot of guys who like strong women, they really freak out if you're not strong 24/7. Or they complain about you being strong, then the moment you're not strong, they're like, 'Oh, no, no, no.'
Many men and women in the world demonstrate great willpower and self-discipline in overcoming bad habits and the weaknesses of the flesh.
It's okay to be a fat man. It's prestige and power and all of that. But fat women are seen as just lazy and stupid and having no self-control.
Men are going to go out on the road and they're going to find other women. So if you really want to save yourself a whole lot of heartache, do not fall in love with somebody in a band. Just don't.
I'm going to guess Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, all want clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. I'm sure most people think women should be paid the same as men if they're doing the same job. I think we all want good schools for our kids. If we made that list, we actually are in agreement on more things.
The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn't have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.
Confidence is at the root of so many attractive qualities, a sense of humor, a sense of style, a willingness to be who you are no matter what anyone else might think or say and it's true, I do have a certain fondness for women that have dark hair.
Growing up in politics I know that women decide all elections because we do all the work.
Why is computer science a good field for women? For one thing, that's where the jobs are, and for another, the pay is better than for many jobs, and finally, it's easier to combine career and family.
You've gotta do things that make you happy. As women, we tend to give away a lot. We take care of a lot of people, and we can't forget to take care of ourselves.
You can be with one of the most beautiful women in the world and still be unhappy.
Now that women are jockeys, baseball umpires, atomic scientists, and business executives, maybe someday they can master parallel parking.
Young men of this class never do anything for themselves that they can get other people to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the devotion, the superstition of others that keeps them going. These others in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred are women.
I've been out with some extremely beautiful women who have had no sex appeal whatsoever. It really is a lot more than skin deep.
Let's face it, I only practice yoga because the classes are always packed with beautiful women.
I always believed that women have rights and that there are some women that are intelligent enough to claim those rights. There are some others that are stupid enough not to.
Women are responsible for their children, they cannot sit back, waste time and see them starve.
Women will only have true equality when men share with them the responsibility of bringing up the next generation.
As women are empowered, violence can come down, for a number of reasons. By all measures, men are the more violent gender.
America's finest - our men and women in uniform, are a force for good throughout the world, and that is nothing to apologize for.
Women have been taught that, for us, the earth is flat, and that if we venture out, we will fall off the edge. Some of us have ventured out nevertheless, and so far we have not fallen off. It is my faith, my feminist faith, that we will not.
I like my whisky old and my women young.
I've always been attracted to women who are assertive and have confidence - qualities older women possess. They've been on the Earth a little longer. They're more seasoned. They don't play games. They know what they want, and they're not afraid to tell you.
Women now have choices. They can be married, not married, have a job, not have a job, be married with children, unmarried with children. Men have the same choice we've always had: work, or prison.
We women continue to swallow this line that it's unladylike or even proof of being a lesbian if you wear flat shoes like Doc Martens. I'm prepared to put up with that accusation, because at least my feet aren't killing me and I don't look like a bandy ostrich.
Too often, older women are seen as victims, but I know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life, and children and friends and family.
Perhaps women have always been in closer contact with reality than men: it would seem to be the just recompense for being deprived of idealism.
I want people to be afraid of the women I dress.
Women don't take enough risks. Men are just 'foot on the gas pedal.' We're not going to close the achievement gap until we close the ambition gap.
I don't hate being compared with female musicians. I don't mind that at all. I have no problem with seeing connections between women's work.
Beguiling voices in the world cry out for 'alternative lifestyles' for women. They maintain that some women are better suited for careers than for marriage and motherhood.
Women are very attracted to a low voice because it's linked to testosterone, which for millions of years was a sign that men had very good spacial skills and would have been very good at hunting and finding their way back home.
I believe that women should live for love, for motherhood and for intellect, and I believe we shouldn't have to choose. And I believe that's always been difficult for women, to express themselves intellectually, maternally, and passionately.
I really think we need more women to lean into their careers and to be really dedicated to staying in the work force.
In my generation, except for a few people who'd gone into banking or nursing or something like that, middle-class women didn't have careers. You were to marry and have children and be a nice mother. You didn't go out and do anything. I found that I got restless.
Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea. It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop slapping us.
If I were a girl, I'd despair. The supply of good women far exceeds that of the men who deserve them.
I've gone from being quite wealthy, when I was defending women, to being quite poor defending men.
Women have to harness their power - its absolutely true. It's just learning not to take the first no. And if you can't go straight ahead, you go around the corner.
I grew up with all mothers, all women. I come from a long line of matriarchs, very strong women.
Women's issues have always been a part of my life. My goal is to bring the word 'feminism' back into the zeitgeist and reframe it.
What works for men does not always work for women, because success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. That's what the research shows. As a man gets more successful, everyone is rooting for him. As a woman gets more successful, both men and women like her less.
As someone who's spent time with our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan on USO tours and met wounded warriors at Walter Reed and Bethesda, I feel a deep obligation to the men and women who have risked life and limb on our behalf.
Pregnancy was probably the best and the hardest thing I'll ever go through. I know for a lot of women, it can be wonderful and relatively easy.
No, men and women of the Irish race, we shall not fight for England. We shall fight for the destruction of the British Empire and the construction of an Irish republic.
Men think about women. Women think about what men think about them.
The common erotic project of destroying women makes it possible for men to unite into a brotherhood; this project is the only firm and trustworthy groundwork for cooperation among males and all male bonding is based on it.
Frankly, too many women treat their husbands as accessories instead of priorities.
Make no mistake: Bob Ritchie's up early in the morning taking pictures of his son on the first day of his senior year. Kid Rock is passed out in a hotel room somewhere with four scantily-clad women.
I think one of the biggest things that affects young women is when they hear their mothers using fat talk.
Something about glamour interested me. All my schoolbooks had drawings of women on terraces with a cocktail and a cigarette.
The repossession by women of our bodies will bring far more essential change to human society than the seizing of the means of production by workers.
I know so many women in their fifties, sixties and seventies who delight in being on their own. It's amazing. They don't see any stigma attached to it. We don't need a man to prove our identity anymore.
Aren't women prudes if they don't and prostitutes if they do?
Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.
I think that women are more sensitive to emotional infidelity than men. I think men are more scared of physical infidelity.
The runway symbolizes something in society that's very intimidating to women.
If I have any particular appeal to women, maybe it's because I listen more than other guys do and appreciate how they think and feel about things.
Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. The women's movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There's no room for dissent.
Feminism is not only for women It's something everyone can participate in, and evolve together, as the first step in the right direction. I see feminism as a tool to achieve that balance and peace.
As women in industrial societies join the paid workforce, they gain the economic means to depart unhappy marriages more easily.
I never saw music in terms of men and women or black and white. There was just cool and uncool.
Women are strong now. Women are dominating the charts, and women are doing it for themselves. We're kicking butt and taking no prisoners.
Are some women and children going to die? Yeah. But it's doing the right thing. You got money, you sit around talking about peace. People who don't have money need some help.
I gravitate toward women.
Most urgently, women's identity must be premised upon our 'beauty' so that we will remain vulnerable to outside approval, carrying the vital sensitive organ of self-esteem exposed to the air.
I've always maintained that men were more romantic than women.
The problem with feminism in the second wave was that we fought so much among ourselves, and I think we did so much damage to the movement... and I think the next wave, the third wave, is women mentoring younger women and women helping younger women to enter the political process and the writing world.
In times of conflict, war, poverty or religious fundamentalism, women and children are the first and most numerous victims. Women need all their courage today.
For a man to strike any women is most brutal, and I, as well as everyone else, think this far worse than any attempt to shoot, which, wicked as it is, is at least more comprehensible and more courageous.
I want to encourage women to embrace their own uniqueness. Because just like a rose is beautiful, so is a sunflower, so is a peony. I mean, all flowers are beautiful in their own way, and that's like women too.
Women have the same privileges and opportunities as men, given the New Testament. Relegating women to second-class citizenship was abolished when Jesus died on the cross.
Until women themselves reject stigma and refuse to feel shame for the way others treat them, they have no hope of achieving full human stature.
In Europe, we admire grown-up women; I think men revere older women.
Men are strong, women are smart, but no matter how smart, their bellies are always there to betray women and that's their downfall.
For a long time, society put obstacles in the way of women who wanted to enter the sciences.
The Teen Challenge ministry was born out of those humble early days of ministry. It now includes over 500 drug and alcohol rehab centers around the world, even in Muslim countries. These include homes for girls and women addicts and alcoholics, all which are reaching many.
I'm the old-fashioned type who prefers to meet a woman in a more normal setting. I don't like to feel that I'm being hunted down. I've always liked to do my own hunting when it comes to meeting women.
Women have said the most malicious, disgusting things about me. But I know that when somebody comments about you, good or bad, it is 99 percent of the time their projection of how they feel about themselves.
Men are distinguished from women by their commitment to do violence rather than to be victimized by it.
Fasting is, first and foremost, an exercise for identifying and managing adversity in all its forms. With faith, in full conscience, fasting calls women and men to an extra degree of self-awareness.
The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at twenty-one than you did at ten.
There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars.
I think scent is sensual. I guess evoking a mood or a spirit is key, and I think with the women's fragrances we have evoked different types, moods or sensibilities of a woman - whether it's Daisy with the sweetness and the innocence or Lola which is more provocative, sexy and sultry.
You have to be desirable. And that's why so many woman of my age or even younger are pushed to Botox and plastic surgery, all the things that people say, 'Why do women do this?' Where do you go in your 50s in your career?
I love Sweden. The entire world should be like Sweden. They all like to drink and get naked, and the women are hot. I can't think of a better nation on the planet.
Women don't go to war to kill other women. Wars and armies and nuclear weapons are essentially heterosexual hobbies.
Women still remember the first kiss after men have forgotten the last.
My customer has her own sense of style and knows herself well. My goal is to help women become the best version of themselves.
Is there discrimination against women? Yes. There's no denying that the old boys' network is alive and well. But there's also discrimination against men.
In the X-Men the women are so strong and sexy! We really kick some male butt!
I'm not going to dinner with somebody who eats like a bird, nor do I want to eat like a bird. But its weird: In our business, I'm a size 2 and considered curvy. Its important to remind young women, 'Listen, even skinny girls have cellulite, even Halle Berry has cellulite, and what you see in photos isn't totally real.'
Many women have asked me if it is possible to have a well-built wardrobe on a limited budget. 'Money,' I tell them, 'is no guarantee of taste, and an overstuffed wardrobe is often as bare as a skeleton when it comes to wearable apparel.'
If you don't want women to do whatever they need to do then you must provide them with food, you must provide them with shelter and their basic human rights.
Saudi Arabia operates according to the belief that God made young men and women so utterly and completely without self-control that they must be physically segregated every moment of the day and night.
Women are not in love with me but with the picture of me on the screen. I am merely the canvas on which women paint their dreams.
Two phrases I hate in reference to female characters are 'strong' and 'feisty.' They really annoy me. It's the most condescending thing. You say that about a three-year-old. It infantilises women.
Rescuing women from their burden of unwarranted guilt is going to require 'educational practices and socializing agents' even more effective than the ones that have been relentlessly loading female humans with responsibility for other people's behavior from their earliest childhood.
The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion.
I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world, considering us as a civilized and a Christian country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women.
I live in a house with four women. Just shut up and say, Yes, ma'am.
I consider abortion to be a deeply personal and intimate issue for women and I don't believe male legislators should even vote on the issue.
In the last three years of racing I've met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it's the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.
The search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women.
I was born in Israel, to Canadian parents. My father immigrated in 1948, part of a wave of young men and women who came as pioneers, to fight for a Jewish homeland. Their motive was in large part a reaction to the Holocaust, and their slogan was 'Never Again.'
In New York, if you weigh under 200 pounds and decline so much as a cookie at a co-worker's party, women will flock to your side, assuring you of your appealing physique. This is how skittish we are about the dangers of anorexia and the pressures of body image.
I was trying to uphold what I thought feminism was as best I could by supporting women, by trying to create an opportunity to get women to get together, play music together and celebrate the fact that we are having great success making music on our own and together.
As women, we all have certain weaknesses. I know one who can't resist pretty shoes but has nothing suitable to wear with them. Others adore frilly lingerie but never have any money to buy outer clothing.
My go-to gifts are scarves from my friend Matin Maulawizada's nonprofit organization, Afghan Hands, which supports disenfranchised women in Afghanistan. In exchange for their beautiful embroidery, the women are given financial aid and classes in math and literacy. The scarves are all stunning and one of a kind.
Population growth is straining the Earth's resources to the breaking point, and educating girls is the single most important factor in stabilizing that. That, plus helping women gain political and economic power and safeguarding their reproductive rights.
The valor and courage of our young women and men in the armed services are a shining example to all of the world, and we owe them and their families our deepest respect.
I think Hispanic women are beautiful with their curves. I'm not sure who feels that way in Hollywood. I was never told to lose 50 pounds. If they think that they just don't bother with you. You just don't get the role and you never know why. That's still better than physically harming yourself and becoming unhealthy just to star in a movie.
It is incredible how far women have come and women in sports have come.
I told myself that I would not come back to women's fashion until I felt I had something new to say. I feel that fashion has become too serious and that the actual customer's needs have not really been addressed. Fashion needs to make one happy. It is a luxury and should enhance one's quality of life.
My advice to women in general: Even if you're doing a nine-to-five job, treat yourself like a boss. Not arrogant, but be sure of what you want - and don't allow people to run anything for you without your knowledge.
Half of architecture students are women, and you see respected, established female architects all the time.
Why don't women have respect for themselves nowadays? What happen to the woman who learned her grandmama's recipes and made her man sweet potato pie? I tell you, they don't make 'em like they used to. Will my real women stand up, please?
I love to wear lingerie. The problem is that men always rip it off too quickly. When women are dolled up in lingerie they feel sexy. So let us wear it for five minutes.
No one doubts that innocent men, women and children have been the victims of chemical weapons attacks in Syria. And there's no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons in Syria: the Syrian regime.
When I first started, it was really an innocent response to the needs of women in rural areas. When we started planting trees to meet their needs, there was nothing beyond that. I did not see all the issues that I have to come to deal with.
I'll immediately gain, like, 5 pounds even just by thinking about cutting out dessert. It's a nightmare. I decided, for me, the healthiest thing was to eat what I want and just exercise. Some women can watch what they eat, but I just can't do that.
One of the things I've realised is that I am very simple. My wife asked me once if I loved her. I said: 'Look love, I'm a simple man. I love you. End of story.' But I guess you gotta keep saying it with women. I guess she needed reassurance.
No nation, savage or civilized, save only the United States of America, has confessed its inability to protect its women save by hanging, shooting, and burning alleged offenders.
The dual scourge of hunger and malnutrition will be truly vanquished not only when granaries are full, but also when people's basic health needs are met and women are given their rightful role in societies.
You know, it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.
The nation's government has just handed me the bill that grants us our civil rights. I am receiving it before you, certain that I am accepting this on behalf of all Argentinean women, and I can feel my hands tremble with joy as they grasp the laurel proclaiming victory.
As a child I experienced firsthand the severe effects of poverty and illiteracy, especially upon women and children. My parents taught me the importance of education and that it was a key to improving an individual's life.
A lot of men do have a fear of my ultra-femininity. Sometimes people say I look like a drag queen, that I look scary, but I think that's a fear of my confidence. Most women in contemporary culture pare down their femininity, so there's a slight androgyny about them, and I think men have got used to seeing that.
'Power' is an explosive word, particularly when applied to women.
When I was a young boy, growing up in Durham, North Carolina, the women in my family were truly passionate about their clothes; nothing was more beautiful to me than women dressing with the utmost, meticulous attention to accessories, shoes, handbags, hats, coats, dresses and gloves to attend Sunday church services.
I confess I sometimes sneak a peek at 'The Big Bang Theory.' I chuckle at their antics. But I cringe when they portray physicists as clueless nerds who are doormats when it comes to picking up women.
The middle of 'America's Women' is about the Civil War, and how women, black and white, confronted slavery and abolition. As in every other period of crisis, the rules of sexual decorum were suspended due to emergency.
I am not handsome, but when women hear me play, they come crawling to my feet.
Flexible working is not just for women with children. It is necessary at the other end of the scale. If people can move into part-time work, instead of retirement, then that will be a huge help. If people can fit their work around caring responsibilities for the elderly, the disabled, then again that's very positive.
We have to nurture our young women and understand the beauty and the strength of being a woman. It's kind of a catch-22: Strength in women isn't appreciated, and vulnerability in women isn't appreciated. It's like, 'What the hell do you do?' What you do is you don't allow anyone to dictate who you are.
We live in a world where sports have the potential to bridge the gap between racism, sexism and discrimination. The 2012 Olympic Games was a great start but hopefully what these games taught us is that if women are given an opportunity on an equal playing field the possibilities for women are endless.
People on death row, the treatment of animals, women's right to choose. So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!
In the seventies we had to make it acceptable for people to accept girls and women as athletes. We had to make it okay for them to be active. Those were much scarier times for females in sports.
In terms of having the American people look at the court and think of it as being fair and appropriate for our nation, it helps to have women, plural, on the court.
I am always someone who follows the research more than my self-interest. It certainly has not been in my self-interest to defend men. I've gone from being quite wealthy, when I was defending women, to being quite poor defending men.
Like men, women have to be diligent and work hard.
A beautiful bouquet or a long-lasting flowering plant is a traditional gift for women, but I have recommended that both men and women keep fresh flowers in the home for their beauty, fragrance, and the lift they give our spirits.
The best way to protect young black, brown, men of color, women of color, is to actually stop profiling, stop the prejudice, and stop the judgment first.
I conceive there lies a clear rule in Titus that the elder women should instruct the younger and then I must have a time wherein I must do it.
Why are video games so violent? The ones I've seen remind me of the 4th of July, with everything exploding, buildings, cars, airplanes, men and women. Kill, kill, and kill for sport and entertainment.
Gender equality will only be reached if we are able to empower women.
Until we command the exact same salary as every male counterpart, I feel a political desire to stand by other women. If we don't stand together, that equality will never be fully realized, and that bothers me.
Grameen Bank was formed as an institution owned by its borrower members, who are poor women. Through its unique decision-making process, Grameen Bank has given millions of women the means to emerge from the shadows in a male-dominated society and to make something of themselves.
The Saudi government's denial of basic rights to women is not only wrong, it hurts Saudi Arabia's economic development, modernization and prosperity.
Growing up, I looked up to major league baseball players, and now these young women have amazing, incredible women all across the board, from swimming to gymnastics to softball to basketball.
I don't think I really have any wisdom. Stay out of trouble. Good luck. Stay away from women because they will burn you, haha.
Men and women are like right and left hands; it doesn't make sense not to use both.
We ought to have more women in various management positions, because women are the ones who decide almost everything in the home.
I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the bitterness and sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realisation of social injustice.
What I am defending is the real rights of women. A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother.
Most female CEOs have been more understanding than their male counterparts, of the stress that new mothers experience to 'do it all,' which often means, 'all by themselves.' Why? They've been there. They understand the policies needed to keep women in the workforce.
As women professional athletes, you have to have respect for every player and individual. Beyond that, it doesn't matter what your interests are. People can have their own lives.
Men can absent themselves from real life for their art more easily. Women are anchored into the quotidian business of getting food on the table, making sure everybody's socks match, the soccer gear is ready. I admire idealists, but they're usually enabled by someone who holds the tether on their balloon, who pays the bills and sweeps up after them.
I like women's basketball.
I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there, she's had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.
I really want to make clothes that are feminine and help women look beautiful.
Modern women - we're very good at keeping ourselves busy. There are PTA meetings, exercising, bake sales at school. I like that my life is not the same every day.
I enjoy how women dressed in the 1920s with the shimmering jewels and rich feathers.
I grew up surrounded by these tough, ballsy, strong women. They were also adoring women, but they were the kind of women who would argue over what kind of pants you were wearing or the color of your nail polish.
Imagine a country that flies into space, launches Sputniks, creates such a defense system, and it can't resolve the problem of women's pantyhose. There's no toothpaste, no soap powder, not the basic necessities of life. It was incredible and humiliating to work in such a government.
Women are not so well united as to form an Insurrection. They are for the most part wise enough to love their Chains, and to discern how becomingly they fit.
I am in awe of women who have full family lives and seem to work round the clock in the 24/7 news cycle.
There is definitely a way in which women are raised to be less proactive, less business-oriented, and less willing to jump into creative no man's land. I think media has more of an influence on how we perceive gender identity than anything else.
Why should I limit myself to only one woman when I can have as many women as I want?
I haven't experienced love at first sight yet. I've seen very, very beautiful girls and been awestruck but never love at first sight. I think confidence goes such a long way with women. A girl who is confident with who she is and she can really flaunt that is really sexy.
I believe in the critical importance of participating in the political system - from voting to standing for election. It's both rewarding and necessary that men and women of good will and clear thinking engage in honest, open debate.
I'm actually just playing honest, whole young women.
I believe it's time that women truly owned their superpowers and used their beauty and strength to change the world around them.
The more we refuse to buy into our inner critics - and our external ones too - the easier it will get to have confidence in our choices, and to feel comfortable with who we are - as women and as mothers.
I had very supportive parents that made the way for me, even at a time when there were very few women - no women, really; maybe two or three women - and very few, fewer than that, African-American women heading in this direction, so there were very few people to look up to. You just had to have faith.
Other women looked on me as a rival. And it pained me a great deal.
Unless men are active allies, we'll never end violence against women and girls.
Women often don't want to admit that they like fashion. And yet fashion enthralls everyone, from the taxi driver to the mega-intellectual. I have often asked myself why this is. I don't know the answer.
I'm a woman, of course I still have curves on me, and that's ok. I had a baby and I've worked hard. And I don't think women should have to feel that kind of pressure. I've done it really healthfully, and I took my time.
I think women have to change their hairstyle from time to time.
My mother never made me do anything for my brothers, like serve them. I think that's an important lesson, especially for the Latino culture, because the women are expected to be the ones that serve and cook and whatever. Not in our family. Everybody was equal.
Women's art, political art - those categorisations perpetuate a certain kind of marginality which I'm resistant to. But I absolutely define myself as a feminist.
Investing in women's lives is an investment in sustainable development, in human rights, in future generations - and consequently in our own long-term national interests.
President Obama is also standing up for women in North Carolina and across our country. He has helped women fight for equal pay for equal work; he has fought to guarantee that women have access to quality, affordable health care, including making sure that insurance plans cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost.
The psychology of women hitherto actually represents a deposit of the desires and disappointments of men.
I think credibility is one of those things that, if you work hard and you get it by standing in the trenches and traveling the world, people realize you're multi-faceted. Part of me is a serious journalist and I loved all of the stuff I did. And then there's another part of me that likes to let go and I think a lot of women can relate to that.
Seeing their children touched and seared and wounded by race prejudice is one of the heaviest crosses which colored women have to bear.
Half of all women who are sexually active, but do not want to get pregnant, need publicly funded services to help them access public health programs like Medicaid and Title X, the national family planning program.
Let's make sure that we don't close down 37 of the 42 clinics in Texas and leave women with nowhere to go and put them in a situation where their health will be at risk, because what we do know is that closing down the ability to access that service unfortunately does not take the need away or women's confronting that issue away.
I play- it's kind of like a slice-of-life, LA women in their forties, playing forty kind of what's their friendship like, and what's their life like and so I just play one of the four friends.
I hope the fathers and mothers of little girls will look at them and say 'yes, women can.'
The important thing to note is that it is not important whether Malala was shot or not - Malala is not asking for personal favors or support. She is asking for support with girls' education and women's rights. So don't support Malala, support her campaign for girls' education and women's rights.
The workingmen have perceived that women are in the field of industry to stay; and they see, too, that there can not be two standards of work and wages for any trade without constant menace to the higher standard.
You think aerobics is not a cool sport? I think you are wrong. It requires amazing discipline - flexibility, fitness, knowledge. And you have to do it with a big smile on your face. Also, I once performed in front of 10,000 screaming women. I tell you something, I'd rather do that than kick a ball around in front of a few men.
New Zealand, by the way, where I was ambassador, has had two women prime ministers - one from either party.
In the different voice of women lies the truth of an ethic of care, the tie between relationship and responsibility, and the origins of aggression in the failure of connection.
When a battle for suffrage is conducted, it should only be conducted according to socialist principles, and therefore with the demand of universal suffrage for women and men.
Like their personal lives, women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and the demands of others.
A large part of the present anxiety to improve the education of girls and women is also due to the conviction that the political disabilities of women will not be maintained.
What he has done for women is final: he gave to their service the best powers of his mind and the best years of his life. His death consecrates the gift: it can never lessen its value.
There are those who maintain that in this world women have no right to interfere in the affairs of state, in politics, in plots and counter-plots. Others that are who, more chivalrous, are willing to admit that women have as much right to act, think, and speak as men.
I know you are going to be embarrassed. We're all embarrassed by it, but to hide the embarrassment... silence has never protected women or helped them. We need to talk about it more with our, you know - whoever - our friends, our family.
In two-parent households, women have increasingly entered the workplace, and in single-parent households, there is even more of a need for the adults to work. That means parents do not fully control their own schedule and have to scramble to find high-quality after-school options.
We need to empower women. Give women a voice in the decision-making process. Give women a political voice where they can champion, for their own welfare. And, of course, for us. United Nations - organizations, agencies - we need to do our part.
I owe a debt of gratitude to two other living Justices. Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg paved the way for me and so many other women in my generation. Their pioneering lives have created boundless possibilities for women in the law. I thank them for their inspiration and also for the personal kindnesses they have shown me.
The men and women of today's VA are dedicated to caring for today's veterans and stand ready to provide for our servicemembers who now defend our freedoms and our way of life.
Temperance is essential, if the services of men and women are to be employed to the best and most useful effect according, to the physical capacity and ability of each. Nothing less will assure a total effort.
Men are not supposed to be mysterious. That's what you say about women. But I think men can have a little of it, too.
I think men are allowed to be fat and bald and ugly and women aren't. And it's just not - there is no equality there.
A lot of people would say 'sexy' is about the body. But to me, 'sexy' is a woman with confidence. I admire women who have very little fear.
Throughout the years, many Christian women have told me of their great respect for the bravery and courage evident in my work, perhaps even gesturing to their own Isis earrings or a Nile River Goddess pendants.
If we are to perpetuate the state, we must not only produce citizens, but good citizens - men and women of sound bodies, clear minds and clean souls.
Women in most countries have not achieved much, because they can't be liberated under the patriarchal, capitalist, imperialist and military system that determines the way we live now, and which is governed by power, not justice, by false democracy, not real freedom.
Women are like dogs really. They love like dogs, a little insistently. And they like to fetch and carry and come back wistfully after hard words, and learn rather easily to carry a basket.
One is that if women's sexuality in Africa wasn't under assault, if women were able to say no, if women weren't subject to predatory attacks by men, or predatory behaviour generally, then you would have a disease in Africa called AIDS. But you wouldn't have a pandemic.
All women should understand that a mammogram is nothing to be afraid of. It's not an enemy but a friend. Early detection is the key to the cure.
The truth is women use contraception not only as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies, but also to improve their health and the health of their families. Increased access to contraception is directly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality.
President Kennedy understood the importance of equal pay for equal work and signed historic legislation that gave women around the country hope that one day their wages would be on par with that of their male counterparts.
As more men become more educated and women get educated, the value system has to be more enhanced and the respect for human dignity and human life is made better.
Genteel women suppose that those things do not really exist about which it is impossible to talk in polite company.
I hope that no more groans of wounded men and women will ever go to the ear of the Great Spirit Chief above, and that all people may be one people.
When women kiss it always reminds one of prize fighters shaking hands.
If women believed in their husbands they would be a good deal happier and also a good deal more foolish.
All the men in my family were bearded, and most of the women.
Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives' mouths.
I've only slept with men I've been married to. How many women can make that claim?
A great city is that which has the greatest men and women.
To be born woman is to know - although they do not speak of it at school - women must labor to be beautiful.
After all, what is your host's purpose in having a party? Surely not for you to enjoy yourself; if that were their sole purpose, they'd have simply sent champagne and women over to your place by taxi.
The strength and power of a country depends absolutely on the quantity of good men and women in it.
You can find women who have never had an affair, but it is hard to find a woman who has had just one.
There's a certain kind of behavior in the Arab world that, to me, resembles the way young men behave when there is no significant influence from women in their lives.
Good women always think it is their fault when someone else is being offensive. Bad women never take the blame for anything.
Women rule the world. It's not really worth fighting because they know what they're doing. Ask Napoleon. Ask Adam. Ask Richard Burton or Richie Sambora. Many a man has crumbled.
The generality of virtuous women are like hidden treasures, they are safe only because nobody has sought after them.
When men and women agree, it is only in their conclusions; their reasons are always different.
If everybody in this town connected with politics had to leave town because of chasing women and drinking, you would have no government.
On one issue at least, men and women agree; they both distrust women.
What Democratic congressmen do to their women staffers, Republican congressmen do to the country.
Run for office? No. I've slept with too many women, I've done too many drugs, and I've been to too many parties.
Strong women only marry weak men.
Whether you're throwing up or breaking up, you want your girlfriend right there! I don't trust women who don't go to their girlfriends.
Women can stand a beating except when it is with their own weapons.
Feminism encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.
They're right to think that about me, because I'm the person most likely to sleep with my female fans, I genuinely love other women. And I think they know that.
There are two kinds of women, those who want power in the world and those who want power in bed.
There are certainly not so many men of large fortune in the world, as there are pretty women to deserve them.
As the mother of two daughters, I have great respect for women. And I don't ever want to lose that.
The most efficient water power in the world - women's tears.
Silence is an ornament for women.
Men reach their sexual peak at eighteen. Women reach theirs at thirty-five. Do you get the feeling that God is playing a practical joke?
A woman asking 'Am I good? Am I satisfied?' is extremely selfish. The less women fuss about themselves, the less they talk to other women, the more they try to please their husbands, the happier the marriage is going to be.
I would go out with women my age, but there are no women my age.
But the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.
I'm for women choosing whatever they want to do but they have to really know what they are doing.
Some women can't say the word lesbian... even when their mouth is full of one.
The thing women have yet to learn is nobody gives you power. You just take it.
Sheer flattery got me into the theater. Flattery always works with me, particularly the flattery of women.
Black women are programmed to define ourselves within this male attention and to compete with each other for it rather than to recognize and move upon our common interests.
Every man needs two women: a quiet home-maker, and a thrilling nymph.
When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?'
Men who love their mothers treat women wonderfully. And they have enormous respect for women.
I'm not convinced that women have the education or the sense of their own history enough or that they understand the cruelty of which men are capable and the delight that many men will take in seeing you choose to chain yourself - then they get to say 'See, you did it yourself.'
The problem is, women have stopped setting the bar high.
I think all women have a friend who at some point dumped them or betrayed them or deeply disappointed them. And at the same time all women have a friend who they dumped or betrayed or hurt in some way. That's universal in women's friendships.
I've never thought about any kind of prejudice about women in country music because I never felt like it affected me. I was fortunate enough to come about in a time when I didn't feel that kind of energy at all, and it was always my theory that if you want to play in the same ballgame as the boys, you've got to work as hard as them.
Never was it given to mortal man - To lie so boldly as we women can.
Some women hold up dresses that are so ugly and they always say the same thing: 'This looks much better on.' On what? On fire?
It's so clear that you have to cherish everyone. I think that's what I get from these older black women, that every soul is to be cherished, that every flower Is to bloom.
I just like to have words that describe things correctly. Now to me, 'black feminist' does not do that. I need a word that is organic, that really comes out of the culture, that really expresses the spirit that we see in black women. And it's just... womanish.
It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.
I think it's time that we have a women's show about the West. The concentration has been on the men and the Indians.
The latest research has revealed that women have a higher IQ than men.
CNN found that Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America. Women admire her because she's strong and successful. Men admire her because she allows her husband to cheat and get away with it.
A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation. There's always a desire to please each one.
I am so used to seeing the sort of play which deals with one man and two women. They do not leave me with the feeling I have made a full theatrical meal they do not give me the experience of the multiplicity of life.
In my work and in myself I reflect black people, women and men, as I reflect others. One day even the most self-protective ones will look into the mirror I provide and not be afraid.
This is an important book, the critic assumes, because it deals with war. This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room.
To conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts.
I want to make a policy statement. I am unabashedly in favor of women.
Women are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.
Women lie about their age; men lie about their income.
Women should stop going for the bad guys, stop looking so far when the good ones are right there.
There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think there's a lot they don't know. Women do. Women want to learn. Men think, 'I know what I'm doing, just show me somebody naked.'
I don't get this whole super-skinny obsession. I really think women look more beautiful when they let their curves show.
